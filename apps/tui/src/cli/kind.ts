// App-vs-plugin classification for the `ryu` CLI.
//
// Apps and plugins share ONE Core lifecycle API: `POST /api/plugins/:id/{install,
// enable,disable,uninstall}` is byte-identical for both, and `GET /api/plugins`
// and `GET /api/plugins/catalog` already return both. "app" vs "plugin" is a
// CATALOG CLASSIFICATION, not a second install path — so the only thing the CLI
// needs is a way to LABEL a row and FILTER a list, which is all this module does.
// Nothing here branches the lifecycle, and nothing should ever start to.
//
// The predicate is deliberately the same one three other places already run:
//   apps/core/src/server/mod.rs                                → `is_app` (the emitter)
//   packages/marketplace/src/catalog/apps-catalog-section.tsx  → `isCompanionApp`
//   apps/desktop/src/hooks/useStoreHome.ts                     → the `isApp` split
// An APP ships a Companion UI surface; everything else is a plugin. It is
// re-expressed here rather than imported because the shared helper lives in
// `@ryu/marketplace`, a React/tsx package the tui does not (and must not) depend
// on — a terminal binary that prints a table has no business pulling in a
// component tree, `@ryu/ui`, and react-dom to do it. Core's `is_app` is the
// upstream source of truth: if the derivation changes it changes there first and
// every mirror, this one included, follows.
