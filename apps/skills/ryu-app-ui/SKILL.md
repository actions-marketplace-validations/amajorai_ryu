# Ryu App UI

Use the Ryu App UI contract for every Companion surface. The app owns its domain data and behavior;
Ryu owns the visual grammar, generic interaction states, and theme.

`v1` is the stable contract version, not a rollout label. A Companion is not v1-compliant until
its entrypoint uses `RyuAppShell`, its CSS imports the shared contract, and its generic chrome is
made from the fixed Ryu roles below.

## Required foundation

- Mark the mounted root with `markCompanionAppRoot` from `@ryu/app-host/companion-theme`.
- Import `@ryu/ui/app-ui.css` from the app's CSS entrypoint.
- Call `subscribeCompanionTheme()` before mounting when the host bridge is available.
- Use `@ryu/ui` for controls, dialogs, menus, badges, status, loading, and empty states.
- Use `@ryu/blocks/companion/app-ui` for app-level composition primitives.
- A dependency-free static satellite that is mirrored outside the monorepo may use a local
  contract-compatible adapter, but it must keep the same v1 root attributes, semantic tokens, and
  navigation ownership. It may not introduce a second visual vocabulary.
- Do not render a primary navigation sidebar inside the Companion. Declare the app's sidebar items
  in `manifest.json` under `contributes.sidebar_sections` / `contributes.sidebar_buttons`; Ryu
  renders them in the hosted shell and in the standalone Ryu App window.

```tsx
import { markCompanionAppRoot } from "@ryu/app-host/companion-theme";
import { RyuAppShell, RyuAppToolbar } from "@ryu/blocks/companion/app-ui";

const root = document.getElementById("ryu-plugin-root");
if (root) {
	markCompanionAppRoot(root);
	root.replaceChildren();
}

export function App() {
	return (
		<RyuAppShell>
			<RyuAppToolbar title="My app" />
			{/* domain content */}
		</RyuAppShell>
	);
}
```

## Fixed vocabulary

Prefer these roles instead of inventing one-off shells:

- `RyuAppShell` - root surface with `standard`, `editor`, and `canvas` modes.
- `RyuAppToolbar` - title and action row.
- `RyuAppMain` and `RyuAppSection` - page structure and grouping.
- `RyuAppList`, `RyuAppListSection`, and `RyuAppListItem` - selectable collection rows.
- `RyuAppDetail` - selected-item or inspector pane.
- `RyuAppForm` and `RyuAppField` - consistent form structure.
- `RyuAppEmpty` and `RyuAppActions` - recovery and action treatment.

Every app entrypoint must compose the mounted component through `RyuAppShell`, even when the app
uses a specialized editor or canvas renderer inside it. This keeps standalone and hosted rendering
on the same visual root.

Use `@ryu/ui` primitives inside those roles. Do not add a second button, card, input, tab, or
theme implementation in the satellite.

## Rules for generated UI

- Do not invent raw colors, radii, shadows, or typography scales.
- Do not use arbitrary gradient or glass treatment to make a surface feel designed.
- Every async surface needs loading, empty, error, offline, and disabled states where applicable.
- Keep domain-specific graph, canvas, media, and editor rendering inside `surface="canvas"` or
  `surface="editor"`; keep its controls on Ryu primitives.
- A domain inspector or canvas tool rail is allowed when it edits the current object. It is not a
  substitute for app navigation and should not contain the app's top-level sections.
- Check the rendered surface in light and dark themes, narrow widths, keyboard focus, and reduced
  motion. A successful typecheck does not prove App UI contract compliance.

## Source of truth

The implementation is in `packages/ui/src/styles/app-ui.css` and
`packages/blocks/src/companion/app-ui.tsx`. Do not copy the token block into an app. If a pattern
is missing, add it to the shared contract once and migrate all consumers to it.
