//! Per-request NODE ROUTING PREFERENCES — the `x-ryu-node-routing` channel.
//!
//! A managed node (Core pointed at the hosted fleet by `remote_data_plane()`)
//! has opinions about routing that used to have nowhere to go. Most of them
//! already do travel: `connect_openai` sends `x-ryu-slot-chat-provider` /
//! `-model`, `x-ryu-prompt-cache(-ttl)`, `x-ryu-agent-id`, `x-ryu-priority`, and
//! the private `ryu_smart_route` body field, so model/provider pinning, smart
//! routing rules and prompt-cache mode reach the fleet today. What did NOT
//! travel — and what this module carries — is the node's **fallback-chain
//! preference** and its **own additive firewall rules**, inside a versioned
//! envelope future knobs can plug into without a second header.
//!
//! # Trust class: exactly as trustworthy as the bearer, i.e. not
//!
//! There is no "trusted node" tier to build on. For a dynamically-resolved
//! `rgw_` token `key_config` is `None` (see `authenticate`'s `TryDynamic` arm),
//! so `ApiKeyConfig::trusted_forwarder` never applies and cannot vouch for
//! anything. `ctx.managed_inference` is a *billing* property, not a trust level.
//! So the preference document is treated as hostile input throughout:
//!
//! * every knob may only **narrow** the org's envelope, never widen it;
//! * anything that would widen it is **IGNORED, never rejected** — a preference
//!   must not fail a turn that would otherwise succeed, and must not pass one
//!   that would otherwise fail. The second half is the easy one to lose: a
//!   dropped preference falls back to the FLEET decision, which is then gated
//!   normally. It never falls back to "skip the gate".
//!
//! # Conflict table — which fleet-side symbol wins, and always wins
//!
//! | Concern                     | Authority (a preference cannot touch it)            |
//! |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
//! | approved model allowlist    | `EffectivePolicy::allows_model`                     |
//! | locked guardrails           | `EffectivePolicy::requires_firewall` + `scan_locked_guardrails` |
//! | firewall/DLP dials          | `FirewallResolver::resolve` — request scope applies under locked = ALL fields |
//! | credit envelope             | `preflight_credit_gate` (per credit pool)           |
//! | wallet-empty action         | `wallet_empty_decision` + `[credits].fail_closed`   |
//! | spend / session budgets     | `state.with_budget`                                 |
//! | rate limit bucket           | `check_request_for_key(&ctx.api_key, …)` — the key is `rgw_org:<id>`, so a preference cannot move the bucket |
//! | prompt-cache override       | `[prompt_cache].allow_request_override`             |
//! | post-call debit attribution | reads the provider that actually answered, never a preference |
//! | provider credentials        | fleet config; nothing here names a key               |
//!
//! # Why fallback is subset-and-reorder only
//!
//! This is load-bearing, not stylistic. `preflight_credit_gate` runs against the
//! PRIMARY provider's credit pool only — `enforce_budget` says so in prose — and
//! it runs BEFORE the chain is expanded at the three `fallback_chain` sites. A
//! preference that could ADD a provider would therefore get a request served out
//! of a pool that was never gated, which is precisely the "never widens the
//! envelope" acceptance criterion inverted. So: every id must already appear in
//! the fleet's own chain, position 0 (the primary) stays pinned by the fleet, and
//! each surviving entry is re-checked against its own pool.
//!
//! # Shape: two clamps, not one, because they run at different times
//!
//! `pre_process` resolves the firewall scanner ONCE at the top, above the stage
//! loop — before `PipelineStage::Route` produces a decision. So the firewall half
//! must be clamped early (it has no dependency beyond node config) while the
//! fallback half needs `decision.provider` and can only run at chain expansion.
//! Folding both into one call would silently apply the overlay to nothing.
//!
//! Every function here is pure: no `AppState`, no live fleet, no I/O. That is
//! deliberate and mirrors why `resolve_prompt_cache_override` was split out of
//! `apply_prompt_cache` — the interesting behaviour is the clamp, and the clamp
//! should be testable on its own.
