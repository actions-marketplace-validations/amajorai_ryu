/**
 * Ryu LSP bridge — a Pi extension that gives the flagship, managed "ryu" (Pi)
 * agent language-server awareness.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Pi has no LSP support of its own. Claude Code does, and its model is the one
 * we copy VERBATIM so a config written for either host works in both: a plugin
 * declares language servers, the HOST spawns them. The declaration is a map of
 * server id -> config, with camelCase field names identical to Claude Code's
 * `.lsp.json` / `lspServers`:
 *
 *   { "go": { "command": "gopls", "args": ["serve"],
 *             "extensionToLanguage": { ".go": "go" } } }
 *
 * REQUIRED: `command` (a binary that must be on PATH) and `extensionToLanguage`.
 * OPTIONAL: `args`, `transport`, `env`, `initializationOptions`, `settings`,
 * `workspaceFolder`, `startupTimeout`, `shutdownTimeout`, `restartOnCrash`,
 * `maxRestarts`, `diagnostics`.
 *
 * The three Claude Code semantics that are load-bearing and are implemented
 * here exactly:
 *   - The declaration ships CONFIG ONLY, never the server binary. A missing
 *     binary is a graceful skip with a VISIBLE REASON, never a hard failure.
 *   - FIRST REGISTRATION WINS per file extension. If two enabled servers both
 *     claim ".go", the first one registered handles it, the others never start
 *     for it, and we emit a warning naming the owner.
 *   - A server with invalid config (no `command`, or no `extensionToLanguage`)
 *     is SKIPPED; the other servers still start, and the skipped server does
 *     NOT claim its extensions.
 *
 * WHERE THE CONFIG COMES FROM (and why it is a sibling file, not an env var)
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Core writes the RESOLVED, agent-bound declaration to
 * `<agentDir>/extensions/ryu-lsp.json`, next to this file. We locate `<agentDir>`
 * through `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, which Core sets on the Pi spawn command and
 * pi-acp forwards to the pi child unchanged.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT an env var carrying inline JSON. Core interpolates env
 * values UNESCAPED into a single command String that the ACP client re-parses
 * with `shell_words::split`; a JSON blob's quotes are quote delimiters there and
 * would be stripped, and on Windows the same string is chained through cmd.exe
 * where `&`, `"`, `^`, `<` and `>` are metacharacters. It is also not an HTTP
 * fetch from Core: the config is Core-authored and would only add a round trip
 * to the critical path to first token.
 *
 * ABSENT OR EMPTY CONFIG === COMPLETE NO-OP. This is the single most important
 * robustness property of this file. No config file, an unreadable one, a
 * malformed one, or one that declares zero usable servers all take the same
 * path: register nothing at all — no tools, no `tool_result` handler, no
 * lifecycle handlers — and return. Pi must start normally with zero LSP servers
 * configured, and four dead `lsp_*` tool schemas would be a prompt-budget cost
 * for no benefit.
 *
 * NO NPM DEPENDENCIES
 * -------------------
 * Pi loads extensions through jiti with a CLOSED module set (the pi packages,
 * typebox, and the legacy aliases). There is no `vscode-jsonrpc` and no
 * `vscode-languageserver-protocol` to import, and adding a `package.json` next
 * to this file would break under Pi's standalone-binary loader, which resolves
 * bare specifiers to nothing at all. So the LSP client below is hand-rolled:
 * `node:child_process.spawn` plus manual `Content-Length: N\r\n\r\n` framing.
 * Node built-ins are available and are the only other runtime imports.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE DISCIPLINE
 * --------------------
 * Extension factories run in invocations that never start a session, so the
 * factory starts NO background resources. Servers are spawned lazily, the first
 * time a file with a claimed extension is actually touched, and torn down from
 * an idempotent `session_shutdown`. Cleanup must handle session REPLACEMENT
 * (`new` / `resume` / `fork`), not just `quit`: pi-acp spawns a fresh Pi RPC
 * process per `session/new` — one per chat turn — so a leaked `gopls` would
 * multiply once per turn.
 *
 * THE REASON CHANNEL IS STDERR
 * ----------------------------
 * `ctx.ui.notify` is not sufficient for the "visible reason" a graceful skip
 * owes the user: over ACP the managed Pi is frequently headless, where the UI
 * methods are no-ops. Core logs the ACP subprocess's stderr at WARN under the
 * `acp_subprocess` target, so stderr is the channel that always survives. The
 * `session_start` status line is decoration layered on top of it. We use no
 * interactive UI method (`select` / `confirm` / `input` / `editor`) at all —
 * those block on a human answering, and would hang a headless turn until
 * timeout rather than fail open.
