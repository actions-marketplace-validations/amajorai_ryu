//! Unified provider/model/strategy registry for Ryu Core (spec unit U030).
//!
//! Placement rationale (Core vs Gateway, see CLAUDE.md §1): deciding *which*
//! model or provider to use for a given role (embedding, chat, reranker …) is
//! "what runs" (orchestration choice), so this belongs in Core. The Gateway
//! governs *what is allowed/measured/paid* — routing policy and budget
//! enforcement stay there.
//!
//! Every model/provider/strategy default is a swappable config entry loaded
//! from `~/.ryu/registry.json` (or `$RYU_REGISTRY_PATH`), falling back to
//! built-in defaults when the file is absent or a field is missing. Environment
//! variables take precedence over file values; the built-in literals are the
//! last-resort fallbacks and are documented as such.
//!
//! # Precedence chain (highest → lowest)
//! 1. Environment variable (e.g. `RYU_DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL`)
//! 2. `~/.ryu/registry.json` field (or `$RYU_REGISTRY_PATH`)
//! 3. Built-in literal constant (last-resort fallback, documented below)
//!
//! # Which constructor you use decides whether layer 2 exists at all
//!
//! The chain above is what [`ProviderRegistry::load`] does. It is **not** what
//! [`ProviderRegistry::from_env`] does: that constructor passes `None` down to
//! `from_file_path`, so no file is ever opened and the chain collapses to
//! *env → literal*. Both constructors still have production callers.
//!
//! That used to make "is this `registry.json` field live?" a question with a
//! per-call-site answer, and several fields were live in one subsystem and dead in
//! another. **That is no longer true, and must not become true again.** The file
//! schema is now exactly the set of fields every one of whose consumers uses
//! [`load`](ProviderRegistry::load); every field any `from_env()` consumer reads has
//! had its file key *deleted*, so the two constructors cannot disagree about
//! anything. See `from_env_and_load_agree_on_every_field_a_from_env_consumer_reads`
//! for the guard that keeps it that way.
//!
//! ## The rule that decides which column a field lands in
//!
//! Not "is a per-call file read cheap?" — it always is. The question is
//! **coherence**: does one consumer of this field produce a durable artifact that a
//! *later, different* consumer must match?
//!
//! - **No artifact ⇒ convert the call site to `load()`.** `rag_strategy` is read
//!   once per Space creation and stamped straight into the row; `reranker_model` /
//!   `reranker_base_url` / `graph_extraction_model` are read once, at store open, and
//!   nothing on disk encodes the previous answer. A mutable file re-read cannot
//!   desync anything.
//! - **An artifact ⇒ delete the file key, leave it env-only.** The nine
//!   `local_*_model_{id,url,sha256}` values name a GGUF that
//!   `sidecar::onboarding::install_local_stack` *downloads* at boot and a llama.cpp
//!   sidecar *serves* arbitrarily later; the artifact is `~/.ryu/models/<id>.gguf`.
//!   The three `embed_*` values decide the vector space of `spaces.db`,
//!   `retrieval.db` and `message-embeddings.db`; the artifact is the stored vectors
//!   (and, for `embed_dims`, the fixed width of the `chunk_vectors` vec0 table,
//!   which `SpaceStore::open_at` does **not** reconcile — only the separate
//!   embedding-model *preference* path triggers `apply_embedder_change` →
//!   `reindex_all`). Making those file-backed does not fix a dead knob; it builds a
//!   live corruption path.
//!
//! `embed_model` on its own looks convertible — every store tags each row with its
//! `embed_model` and filters search to the current one, so a swap merely hides old
//! content until a reindex. It is env-only anyway because it cannot be split from
//! its companions: a file-settable model id with an env-only `embed_dims` lets an
//! operator select a 1024-dim model that still declares 768 and fails at insert, and
//! a file-settable `embed_base_url` repoints the server *without* changing the model
//! id the per-row filter keys on — incommensurable vectors under one tag, silently.
//!
//! ## The resulting schema
//!
//! - **File-backed (all consumers on `load()`):** `default_agent_id`
//!   (`server::list_agents` / `list_agent_catalog`, `main.rs` first-start install,
//!   `sidecar::onboarding`); `default_llm_base_url` / `default_llm_model` /
//!   `providers` (`sidecar::adapters`); `rag_strategy` (`server::create_space` via
//!   `resolve_new_space_mode`); `reranker_model` / `reranker_base_url` /
//!   `graph_extraction_model` (`server::spaces::open_default` and
//!   `rag_host::open_retrieval_store`, both through [`crate::rag_host::retrieval_registry`]).
//!   `reranker_base_url` carries a profile asterisk — it is file-backed on the
//!   release profile and env-shadowed on every other one; see the `RYU_PROFILE`
//!   section below.
//! - **Env-only (no file key at all):** the three `embed_*` values, all nine
//!   `local_*_model_*` values (chat, embed, rerank, classify). Swap them with the
//!   matching `RYU_*` variable.
//!
//! Nothing is "settable but ignored" any more *on the release profile*, which is why
//! there is no longer a boot-time warning listing divergent fields. On any other
//! profile there is exactly one exception, and it is not a bug — see below.
//!
//! # `RYU_PROFILE` shadows part of this chain (the "I set it and nothing happened" case)
//!
//! [`crate::profile::apply_env_defaults`] runs at the top of `main` and seeds
//! profile-derived defaults into the process environment for every **non-release**
//! profile (`bun dev` defaults to `dev`; the release profile is an early-return
//! no-op). It only sets a variable the operator left unset, so an explicit export
//! still wins — but layer 1 of the precedence chain above is *env*, and the file is
//! layer 2. A variable Core seeded for you therefore outranks your `registry.json`
//! exactly as one you exported would.
//!
//! Of the eight variables `apply_env_defaults` seeds, **two** name a field of this
//! registry — and they are shadowed to different degrees, only one of which is a
//! setting the operator loses:
//!
//! - `RYU_EMBED_BASE_URL` → [`ProviderRegistry::embed_base_url`]. **Not a shadow.**
//!   That field has no `registry.json` key, so the seed has no file layer to
//!   outrank; it only replaces the built-in literal `:8081` with the profile's
//!   `:9081`, which is the whole point — that is where the profile's own
//!   `llamacpp-embed` listens.
//! - `RYU_RERANKER_BASE_URL` → [`ProviderRegistry::reranker_base_url`]. **A real
//!   shadow**, and the only one: the sole file-backed key in this schema whose env
//!   twin the profile sets. `reranker_base_url` in `registry.json` therefore cannot
//!   take effect for any developer on `dev` — correct under env > file, live on
//!   release, inert everywhere else. It also flips the *other* reranker from local
//!   to remote; see [`crate::rag_host::reranker_from_registry`].
//!
//! That is the complete set. The other six seeds (`RYU_BIND`, `RYU_GATEWAY_URL`,
//! `GATEWAY_CONFIG`, `RYU_SHADOW_URL`, `RYU_RESEARCH_UPSTREAM`, and `RYU_DIR` —
//! which names no field but relocates the *file*, see below) leave this schema
//! alone. `registry_env_keys_shadowed_by_the_profile_defaults` re-derives the
//! intersection from `profile.rs`'s own source and fails if a future seed lands on
//! another registry key — because the failure mode of that edit is a `registry.json`
//! key that goes quietly dead for everyone running a dev stack, with no error
//! anywhere.
//!
//! ## Second-order: the file the chain reads is itself profile-relative
//!
//! [`registry_path`] falls back to `crate::paths::ryu_dir()`, and
//! `paths::default_ryu_dir()` is suffixed by the profile (`.ryu{suffix}`) *on its
//! own* — `RYU_DIR` being seeded merely pins that answer for child processes, it is
//! not the cause, so unsetting `RYU_DIR` does not restore `~/.ryu` under `dev`.
//! (`paths::resolve` also consults a data-dir pointer file between the env var and
//! that default.) So on the `dev` profile every key in this schema is read from
//! `~/.ryu-dev/registry.json`. Editing `~/.ryu/registry.json` and seeing nothing
//! change is the expected outcome, not a dead key.
//!
//! # API keys
//! API keys are intentionally **not** stored in `registry.json`. Keep them in
//! environment variables (`RYU_DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
//! `registry.json` is config, not a secrets file.
