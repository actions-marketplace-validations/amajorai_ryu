//! Claude Code gateway-routing toggle (subscription-preserving egress
//! governance).
//!
//! Claude Code (`acp:claude`) speaks the Anthropic Messages wire format and, on a
//! Pro/Max **subscription**, authenticates with the user's own OAuth bearer — not
//! an API key. Its LLM egress therefore bypasses the Ryu gateway unless the user
//! explicitly opts in. This toggle controls routing that egress
//! through the gateway's **transparent passthrough proxy**
//! (`apps/gateway/src/passthrough`): Core injects `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at spawn so
//! Claude Code's internal HTTP client points at the gateway, which forwards the
//! caller's own subscription bearer upstream UNCHANGED while applying request-side
//! DLP + audit.
//!
//! **Subscription-preservation rule:** we inject ONLY `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. We
//! must never set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` — either would take
//! precedence over the subscription OAuth and flip Claude Code onto API-key
//! billing. The injection is in [`crate::sidecar::adapters::acp::claude_gateway_cmd`].
//!
//! On by default for a newly installed ACP agent, matching the governed baseline
//! for routable agents. Because this changes how the user's subscription
//! credential flows, the UI keeps a clear per-agent direct-egress opt-out.
//! Mirrors [`crate::composio_auth`]: a process-global flag seeded from the
//! `claude-gateway-routing` preference at startup and on change, read
//! synchronously on the (sync) spawn path.
