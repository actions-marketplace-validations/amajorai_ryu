//! Safe Mode — boot the node with the whole extension layer switched off.
//!
//! The OS analogy is exact and deliberate: safe mode loads the base system and
//! refuses to load anything third-party, so a user chasing a hang, a runaway
//! process, or a memory leak can establish a baseline in one step instead of
//! disabling thirty things one at a time.
//!
//! ## What it suppresses
//!
//! - **Apps and plugins** — [`crate::plugins::PluginStore::list`] reports every
//!   non-kernel record as `enabled = false`, and every runtime consumer already
//!   filters on that flag. Turn hooks, capability adapters, plugin sidecars,
//!   plugin MCP servers, contributed panels/settings-tabs/slash-commands,
//!   app-event hooks and ext-proxy routes all fall out of that single read.
//! - **Skills** — the SKILL.md injection block is not written into outgoing
//!   requests (see `sidecar::adapters`).
//! - **User-configured MCP servers** — `~/.ryu/mcp.json` entries are not merged
//!   into the spawn map, so no `npx` children are launched.
//! - **The scheduler** — cron/monitor/workflow tick loops do not spawn.
//!
//! ## What stays on, and why
//!
//! "Disable everything" taken literally bricks the very session the user is
//! troubleshooting in. Safe mode keeps chat, agents, auth, updates, the settings
//! surface, and the safe-mode switch itself. On the plugin side that means the
//! kernel tiers — [`crate::plugins::builtins::MANDATORY_PLUGINS`] (the data and
//! capability planes Core resolves through) and
//! [`crate::plugins::builtins::LOAD_BEARING_PLUGINS`] (engines/durable/agents).
//! Those sets are DERIVED here, never re-listed: a second copy would drift from
//! the disable path and the failure mode is a node that boots without Spaces.
//!
//! Built-in, in-process MCP tools also stay: they cost nothing to register and
//! removing them would break the tool surface chat itself uses.
//!
//! ## Non-destructive by construction
//!
//! Safe mode NEVER writes the `enabled` column. It masks reads. That is what
//! makes leaving it a no-op — flip the switch back and every app the user chose
//! is exactly as it was — and what makes a crash mid-toggle harmless. The
//! invariant is asserted by `safe_mode_masks_reads_without_writing_records`.
//!
//! ## Resolution: three tiers, checked in order
//!
//! 1. `RYU_SAFE_MODE=1` — the env override, same idiom as `RYU_PROFILE` and the
//!    `RYU_*_BIN` overrides.
//! 2. `~/.ryu/safe-mode` — a sentinel FILE. This tier exists because the reason
//!    you need safe mode is often that Core will not come up: reading the flag
//!    out of `preferences.db` is circular when the SQLite store or the boot path
//!    is what is wedged, and the desktop cannot POST to a Core that is not
//!    serving. The desktop can always write this file and restart the process.
//! 3. `safe-mode.enabled` preference — the normal path, and the one that fans out
//!    to every surface for free over the existing preferences SSE stream.
//!
//! ## Applies on restart
//!
//! Toggling persists the flag and asks for a Core restart; suppression happens at
//! BOOT, before anything spawns. A live mask would leave every sidecar, MCP child
//! and scheduler loop that already started still burning CPU — which is exactly
//! the cost the user is trying to measure away. So the resolution below runs in
//! `main.rs` right after the preferences store opens and BEFORE the default-on
//! seed, the MCP registry, the sidecar `start_all`, and the scheduler spawn.
