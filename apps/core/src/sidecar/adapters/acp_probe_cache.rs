// apps/core/src/sidecar/adapters/acp_probe_cache.rs
//
// The cache behind [`super::acp::probe_acp_config`] — the one place in Core that
// spawns an agent subprocess just to ask what it advertises (`initialize` +
// `session/new`). Every surface that renders an agent picker funnels through
// that probe: the composer's Agent · Model · Thinking dropdown
// (`use-composer-acp-sections.ts`), `GET /api/agents/:id/capabilities`, the
// agent-selection field, Settings → Agent models, the Warmup app. So this is the
// only place worth caching, and caching here fixes all of them at once.
//
// What was wrong before: the cache was an in-process `HashMap<String, Value>`
// with no expiry, populated ONLY on success. Two consequences, both user-visible:
//
//   1. A failing probe was never recorded, so every single read re-spawned the
//      agent and re-waited the full 30s ceiling. An agent whose `session/new`
//      hangs (Codex against an unreachable/unauthenticated backend, a signed-out
//      subscription agent) therefore cost 30s per mount — and the desktop's
//      `useAcpConfig` retries twice, so opening one new chat could spend 90s
//      spawning subprocesses before showing an empty picker. That is the
//      "it keeps detecting every time I start a new chat" report.
//   2. The map died with the process, so every Core restart re-probed from cold.
//
// So the cache is now: persisted across restarts, TTL'd in both directions,
// single-flighted, and refreshed in the background rather than in the user's
// face. The four properties, and why each one is load-bearing:
//
//   - **Failures are cached too**, on a much shorter TTL than successes. Long
//     enough that a broken agent stops costing 30s per chat; short enough that a
//     user who fixes the cause (starts their backend, connects to the network)
//     doesn't sit in a stale error. The auth transitions that can fix it
//     *deterministically* — `authenticate_acp` / `logout_acp` — call
//     [`invalidate`] and don't wait for the TTL at all.
//   - **Stale-while-revalidate.** A TTL that blocks on refresh just moves the
//     spinner. Past the TTL the cached answer is returned immediately and the
//     re-probe runs detached, so the ONLY blocking probe a user can ever hit is
//     the very first one for an agent they have never opened.
//   - **Single-flight per spawn command.** Opening a window mounts several
//     pickers at once; without this each mount spawns its own subprocess of the
//     same agent.
//   - **Only successes are persisted.** A failure written to disk would survive
//     the restart that most plausibly fixes it (Core relaunched with a reachable
//     backend), so failures stay in memory and die with the process.
//
// The freshness stamp is what makes persistence safe. A probe result pinned to
// disk with no validity signal is worse than re-probing: upgrade `claude`, it
// gains a mode, and the picker shows the old set forever. For an agent spawned
// from a real binary on PATH we fingerprint that binary (resolved real path +
// mtime + size, via `acp::resolve_in_path`), so an upgrade invalidates the entry
// the moment it lands. Agents spawned through a package runner (`npx -y …`) have
// no such signal — the `npx` shim is unchanged when the package updates — so they
// fall back to the TTL alone, which the background refresh keeps cheap.
//
// ── Why a key is not just the spawn command ──────────────────────────────────
//
// An agent's advertised option SET can depend on the values already selected in
// the session — the ACP `session/set_config_option` response returns the whole
// refreshed list precisely so a client can observe that. opencode is the live
// example: it advertises an `effort` (reasoning) option only while the session's
// model has effort levels, so the same binary answers differently depending on
// which model was applied first. The probe therefore takes the selections it
// applied, and they are part of the cache key — otherwise the first model probed
// would pin the option set for every other model.
//
// [`invalidate`] consequently drops EVERY key for a spawn command, not one. An
// auth transition invalidates what the agent advertises for all selections, and
// clearing only the no-selection entry would leave the picker the user actually
// has open serving a stale pre-login answer.
