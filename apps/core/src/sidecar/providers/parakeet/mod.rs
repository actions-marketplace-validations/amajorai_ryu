//! Parakeet v3 voice (STT) engine — ONNX-based, runs **alongside** whisper.cpp.
//!
//! Why a separate engine: parakeet is an NVIDIA FastConformer-TDT model that runs
//! on ONNX Runtime, not GGML — whisper.cpp cannot load it. We embed the Rust
//! `transcribe-rs` library (the same engine Handy uses) in-process to run it.
//! Because ONNX Runtime is a heavy native dependency, the actual inference is
//! gated behind the `voice-parakeet` cargo feature; the model download, catalog,
//! lifecycle, and `/api/voice/transcribe` routing are always present so enabling
//! the feature is the only step needed to light it up.
//!
//! Unlike whisper (an external `whisper-server` process Core proxies over HTTP),
//! parakeet is a library with no server, so there is no process to spawn — the
//! "engine" is an in-process, lazily-loaded model. The Sidecar lifecycle here
//! maps to *model loaded in memory* (start = ensure downloaded + load; stop =
//! unload). It is opt-in (not in `startup_order`), matching the voice-engine
//! download-only default.
//!
//! **Lean builds never claim to be running.** A build compiled without
//! `voice-parakeet` cannot transcribe at all, so this lifecycle refuses to start
//! and reports [`HealthStatus::Unhealthy`] naming the missing feature (see
//! [`FEATURE_MISSING`]). It used to download the model, `warn!` once, and then
//! mark itself loaded — which made `health_check()` say `Healthy`, `is_running()`
//! say `true`, and the desktop's `VoiceInputSettings` print "Running" for an
//! engine whose every transcription 500s. A capability the binary does not have
//! must be visibly absent, not silently broken.
