//! Core's kernel side of the extracted [`ryu_rag`] seam — the **single resolver**
//! through which every embedder/reranker/retrieval-store in the process is
//! constructed.
//!
//! `ryu-rag` owns the RAG *primitive* (the `Embedder`/`Reranker` enums, the
//! sqlite-backed `RetrievalStore`, the `RagProvider` trait) built from plain
//! config. What it deliberately cannot own — because they are kernel couplings —
//! are the three reads that decide *which* provider/model is active and *who*
//! owns pre-tenancy chunks: the model registry ([`crate::registry::ModelRegistry`],
//! env > registry.json > local default), the default `~/.ryu` db path
//! ([`crate::paths::ryu_dir`]), and the org/account lookup for the memory-owner
//! backfill ([`crate::sidecar::control_plane`] + [`crate::auth`]).
//!
//! Every RAG construction site in Core funnels through this module (grep-invariant:
//! no `Embedder::`/`Reranker::`/`RetrievalStore::open*` construction lives outside
//! `rag_host` + `#[cfg(test)]`), so a provider swap is a change at exactly one
//! origin — memory, spaces, search, tool-routing and chat retrieval move together,
//! never a silent half-swap. The provider is keyed by [`active_provider_id`]; today
//! only the in-process `"vector"` provider exists and a bound out-of-process id is
//! an **explicit error** ([`open_retrieval_store`]), never a silent fallthrough to
//! vector. A real GraphRAG *sidecar* provider (broker-routed) is the deferred W8
//! follow-on.
//!
//! Mirrors the `search_host`/`crypto_host` precedent (kernel wiring the extracted
//! crate can't own), by *constructor injection* like `ryu-storage`.
