//! Deferring an update to a quiet hour, decided and executed ON THE NODE.
//!
//! WHY LOCAL AND NOT THE CONTROL PLANE. A deferred node RESIZE belongs to the
//! control plane, because the control plane is what calls Hetzner. An update is
//! the opposite: the machine updates and restarts ITSELF, there is no inbound
//! auth path from the control plane into a node, and an unreachable node cannot
//! be told to update anyway. Modelling it centrally would mean the control plane
//! promising something it has no way to perform — which, for a promise the user
//! believes was kept, is the worst possible failure.
//!
//! So the record lives here, the quiet hour is computed in the node's own zone,
//! and the existing scheduler tick applies it. Nothing outside has to be up.
//!
//! DURABLE, NOT A TIMER. The record is a file. An in-process timer would be lost
//! on the very event this feature causes — a restart — so "install tonight"
//! would silently never happen after the first unrelated bounce.
