//! Unified update service — the single source of truth for "what version is
//! installed, what is the latest, and is an update available" across every Ryu
//! surface (desktop, cli, gateway, extension, island, mobile).
//!
//! Placement note (Core vs Gateway, per CLAUDE.md §1): deciding *what runs* —
//! including which build of the binaries runs — is a Core responsibility. The
//! Gateway governs what is *allowed/measured/paid*, not the install lifecycle.
//! So the version/update verdict lives here, and every client reads Core's
//! verdict instead of each re-implementing GitHub-release polling.
//!
//! Versioning model: **single release train**. One Ryu release tag bundles all
//! binaries, so `core`, `gateway`, `cli`, and `desktop` ship the same version.
//! `current_version()` is Core's own `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, which is the canonical
//! Ryu version because the whole workspace is released together. `/api/version`
//! reports the release plus the per-component build list; `/api/update/check`
//! compares that tag against the latest GitHub release.
//!
//! The install *mechanism* is necessarily each platform's native updater
//! (tauri-plugin-updater, electron-updater, expo-updates) — Core owns the
//! *verdict, the toggle, and the binary self-update* for the headless surfaces
//! (core/gateway/cli) that have no native updater of their own.
