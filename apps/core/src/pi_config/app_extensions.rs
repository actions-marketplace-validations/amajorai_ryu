//! Plugin-contributed Pi extensions: enabled plugin manifests → one resolved set
//! the managed Pi's `extensions/` dir is projected onto.
//!
//! A plugin declares an extension in `contributes.pi_extensions`
//! ([`PiExtensionContribution`]) and ships the TypeScript beside its manifest. This
//! module decides which of those declarations a node may actually run, resolves each
//! one's source, and hands the result to [`super::sync_app_pi_extensions`], which
//! owns the disk projection.
//!
//! # Why this lives under `pi_config` and not beside [`crate::lsp`]
//!
//! `lsp.rs` is split out because `contributes.lsp_servers` is genuinely
//! agent-neutral: the declaration says "run gopls", and the managed Pi is only one
//! possible binding for it. A Pi extension has no agent-neutral half — the file is
//! TypeScript against Pi's own extension API, and there is nothing a second agent
//! could bind it to. So the resolver and the binding are one module, inside the
//! module that already owns `~/.ryu/pi-agent`.
//!
//! # Restart semantics
//!
//! Pi reads its extensions when the process boots, so a change here lands on the
//! next Pi **process**, not the next turn — and the managed Pi is pooled per
//! `(conversation, agent, spawn_cmd, cwd)` with its ACP session built once per
//! instance. Enabling or disabling a plugin therefore takes effect in a NEW chat (or
//! after an agent switch, an idle-TTL expiry, a crash, or a Core restart), never
//! mid-conversation. Same posture as [`crate::lsp::ensure_lsp_servers_materialized`],
//! and for the same reason: there is nothing to send a live Pi that would make it
//! re-read.
