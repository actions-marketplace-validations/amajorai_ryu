//! HTTP surface for the threshold fallback rules (`crate::routing_policy`):
//! the rule list a settings screen edits, and the per-turn verdict the composer's
//! info bar renders.
//!
//! `GET /api/routing/advice` is what makes the feature visible instead of
//! spooky. It answers the question the user asks by sending a message — "given
//! what's left, what will actually run?" — *before* they send it, using the same
//! evaluator and the same cached signals the turn itself will use, so the bar
//! cannot disagree with what happens. It is a pure read: no rule is applied, no
//! turn is dispatched, and calling it never changes what a later turn does.
//!
//! Clients are expected to call it once per turn. That is affordable because
//! signal reads are cached with per-source TTLs (see
//! `crate::routing_policy::signals`), so "check the balance every message" costs
//! a preference read and some arithmetic, not three vendor round-trips.
