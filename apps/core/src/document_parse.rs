//! The **`document.parse` facade** — Core's single document-extraction path.
//!
//! Before this module a PDF dropped into the composer was silently discarded: all
//! three desktop composers filtered attachments to `image/*`, and the two chat
//! planes filtered again at [`crate::sidecar::adapters`]. Nothing in the tree read a
//! document. The `unstructured` app (`apps-store/unstructured/`) registered a
//! `document.parse` provider, but the capability had no caller.
//!
//! This is that caller, and it is deliberately the **only** one. Every surface that
//! wants text out of a file goes through these three routes; there is no second
//! extraction path to drift from.
//!
//! ## Shape: submit → poll, never one long request
//!
//! [`parse_document`] returns either a finished result (builtin floor) or a
//! `job_id` to poll ([`parse_job`]). It never blocks on a parse. That is forced by
//! the ext-proxy's activity guard, which drops when response *headers* arrive: a
//! `lazy` + `idle_stop_secs` provider sidecar can be reaped mid-parse if the caller
//! holds one long request open. Polling re-arms the guard. The provider
//! (`ryu_unstructured.server`) is built to the same contract for the same reason.
//!
//! ## The builtin floor is not a fallback, it is a floor
//!
//! A `.txt`/`.md`/`.csv` file *is* its own text. Routing it through a 1-2 GB Python
//! sidecar to learn that would make plain-text attachments depend on an opt-in
//! install, so Core reads those itself ([`builtin_markdown`]) and never consults a
//! provider. The floor is intentionally narrow — UTF-8 families where the bytes are
//! the content. Anything else (PDF, the Office family, EPUB, scanned images) needs a
//! real parser, and when none is bound the caller gets a **415 that names the
//! extension**, so the UI can say "no parser for .pdf — install one" instead of
//! dropping the file.
//!
//! ## What is wired, and what is not — read this before trusting the module doc above
//!
//! This module shipped in `9bf1e2023` with **no `mod document_parse;` line in
//! `main.rs`**. It was not in the module tree, so it had never been compiled, let
//! alone called — the module doc below describes a design, not a running system.
//! Declaring it (and widening `ext_proxy::{resolve_provider_route, ProviderRoute}`
//! to `pub(crate)`) was step zero of wiring Spaces ingest into it.
//!
//! As of that change, **the typed in-process API is live** — [`submit_blob`],
//! [`job_outcome`] and [`builtin_parse`] are called by
//! [`crate::space_file_index`], which is how an uploaded file's contents reach a
//! Space index.
//!
//! **One of the three HTTP routes is registered; two are not, and the split is
//! deliberate.**
//!
//! - [`parse_capability`] **is mounted** (`GET /api/documents/parse/capability`, in
//!   the main route table of `apps/core/src/server/mod.rs`, deliberately *outside*
//!   the Spaces `AppGate` — the bound provider serves chat attachments too, so a
//!   node with Spaces turned off must still be able to read this). Its consumer is
//!   the desktop's **Document parsing** settings panel
//!   (`components/settings/DocumentParsingSettings.tsx`, mounted in the Gateway
//!   dialog), which reads the bound provider's identity, its format list, its
//!   missing native tools and `max_input_bytes` off this one response. Before it
//!   was registered the panel's fetch 404'd, `capability` was `null`, and the two
//!   rows that depend on it rendered nothing at all.
//! - [`parse_document`] and [`parse_job`] are **still unmounted**. Their consumer is
//!   the *composer* attachment flow, which now EXISTS as a seam
//!   (`apps/desktop/src/lib/composer/attachments.ts`, whose `stageComposerFiles`
//!   calls `parseDocument`) but which **no surface imports yet** — the chat page,
//!   the Ask-Ryu dock and the launchpad still filter attachments to `image/*`
//!   inline. A route with a caller nothing calls is still a route with no caller,
//!   so registering them now would only widen the public surface ahead of its use.
//!   Note for whoever wires that seam: `POST /api/documents/parse` must be
//!   registered **with `DefaultBodyLimit::max(MAX_PARSE_BYTES)`**, or axum's
//!   implicit 2 MiB limit rejects the body in the layer before the handler's
//!   `{ code: "too_large" }` can name the real ceiling (see
//!   `crate::server::uploads`' `a_route_without_an_explicit_limit_caps_at_axums_default`).
//!
//! They were left warning ("the `dead_code` warnings on them are accurate") — but a
//! warning is not a decision. Eleven `never used` lines made `cargo check` merely
//! *0-errors* instead of clean, and a reader could not tell this deliberate stub from
//! an oversight; the next person's options were "delete it" or "leave the noise", and
//! both lose the intent. So each still-unmounted route-only item carries an explicit
//! `#[allow(dead_code)]` **with the reason on it**: the gate is the statement that
//! these are unmounted on purpose, and removing the attribute is what the author of
//! the composer surface does on the way to registering them in
//! `apps/core/src/server/mod.rs` — exactly as this change did for
//! [`parse_capability`]. Deleting them was the other honest option and was
//! rejected: they are the designed shape of that surface (submit → poll, floor first,
//! a 415 that names the extension), they compile, and re-deriving them later would
//! re-derive the same three handlers from the same module doc.
//!
//! ## There is no `/api/document-parse/*` and there never was
//!
//! Which backend is bound is **not** served by a bespoke route here. The desktop
//! reads it from the generic capability read model (`GET /api/capabilities`,
//! filtered to `document.parse`) and writes it through
//! `PUT /api/capabilities/bindings`, the same pair every other hot-swappable layer
//! uses. A `document.parse`-specific pair was documented in the desktop client for
//! one release and never existed in Core; see `apps/desktop/src/lib/api/documents.ts`
//! for the removal. Do not add one back: the write endpoint REPLACES the whole
//! override map, so a second write path would have to re-derive the read-merge-write
//! or silently wipe every other capability's selection.
//!
//! ## Provider-agnostic by construction
//!
//! Nothing here names `com.ryu.unstructured`. The provider is resolved through
//! [`crate::plugins::binding`] exactly like `web.search` or `computer.control`:
//! user override > sole provider > declared default > lowest id. A second backend is
//! pure manifest data. The normalized response shape (`status` / `markdown` /
//! `error` / `missing_dependencies`) is this facade's contract, not any one
//! backend's — [`normalize_job`] maps the provider's snapshot onto it.

/// Core can read in-process, in microseconds, with no install at all.

/// # Why it refuses a title that HAS an extension
///
/// This may only *widen* the floor, never redirect a binary into a text reader. A
/// mime is client-supplied and can disagree with the bytes; if the title already says

/// that are not plausibly text instead of lossily converting them. The two guards are

// purpose, because a bare warning cannot distinguish a deliberate stub from an
// oversight — see the module doc for which consumer each is waiting on and for what
// registering them entails (a route table edit in `apps/core/src/server/mod.rs`, a
// `DefaultBodyLimit` on the POST, plus a composer surface that actually imports
// `stageComposerFiles` instead of filtering attachments to `image/*` inline).

///   client-side constant that cannot know which backend is bound;
/// - the composer's file-picker `accept` list is built from `extensions`, so the
///   picker offers exactly what the bound backend (plus the floor) can actually
///   handle instead of a hardcoded guess that drifts the moment a provider is
///   swapped.
