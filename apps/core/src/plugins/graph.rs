//! Plugin dependency graph — resolution, ordering, and cycle detection.
//!
//! This is the foundation for decomposing Ryu into a **minimal kernel plus
//! plugins that depend on other plugins** (npm-shaped, but for features). A
//! manifest declares its edges in [`crate::plugin_manifest::Requires`]; this
//! module turns the resulting graph into the two orders the lifecycle needs:
//!
//! - [`resolve_enable_order`] — the dependencies that must be enabled, in
//!   topological order, ending with the target. Deps first, target last.
//! - [`resolve_disable_order`] — the reverse: the enabled dependents that would
//!   break, in reverse-topological order, ending with the target. Dependents
//!   first, target last.
//! - [`dependents_of`] — the reverse edges (transitive), so a caller can *refuse*
//!   a disable and name exactly who is in the way.
//!
//! # Core-vs-Gateway boundary
//!
//! Pure Core. This module decides **what runs and in what order** — it performs
//! no policy, no I/O, and no grant checks. Grant validation stays where it is
//! (the Gateway, called from [`crate::plugins::lifecycle`]); every plugin this
//! module orders still goes through that gate individually.
//!
//! # The "installed set" contract (important)
//!
//! Every function takes a `&[PluginManifest]` slice that the caller has ALREADY
//! filtered to the relevant lifecycle state:
//!
//! - [`resolve_enable_order`] expects the **installed** manifests. A dependency
//!   absent from the slice is therefore reported as
//!   [`DependencyError::MissingDependency`] — "declared but not installed".
//! - [`dependents_of`] / [`resolve_disable_order`] expect the **installed AND
//!   enabled** manifests, so the dependents they name are exactly the ones that
//!   would actually break.
//!
//! Keeping the filter in the caller is what makes these functions pure and
//! exhaustively testable without a store, a Gateway, or a tokio runtime.
//!
//! # Version semantics
//!
//! A dependency's `min_version` is a **minimum**, not a caret range: a bare
//! `"1.2.0"` means `">=1.2.0"`, so an installed `2.0.0` satisfies it. That single
//! definition lives in [`crate::plugin_manifest::parse_min_version`] and is shared
//! with manifest load-time validation — there is no second semver comparison here.
