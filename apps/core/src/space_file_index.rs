//! **The one path that puts an uploaded file's *contents* into a Space index.**
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! [`ryu_spaces::SpaceStore::create_file`] stores exactly one chunk per file — the
//! `{title}\n{mime}` descriptor. The bytes went to the content-addressed blob store
//! and were never chunked, embedded, or graph-extracted. So uploading a PDF to a
//! Space and asking a question about it matched the *filename* and nothing else:
//! vector search scored the descriptor, graph mode built entities out of the
//! filename, and every retrieval improvement above sat on an index that did not
//! contain the documents.
//!
//! Meanwhile [`crate::document_parse`] — the complete `document.parse` extraction
//! facade, with `markitdown` default-ON precisely so the capability has a provider
//! out of the box — had no caller. It was worse than that: it shipped with **no
//! `mod` line in `main.rs`**, so it was not in the module tree and had never been
//! compiled. Declaring it (and widening two `ext_proxy` items to `pub(crate)`) was
//! step zero of this change.
//!
//! # The seam
//!
//! There are three `create_file` callers — `POST /api/uploads`, `POST
//! /api/spaces/:id/files`, and the `artifact.create` MCP tool. They all route
//! through [`create_file_indexed`] rather than parsing in three places, because two
//! wired and one not is the state a later reader cannot tell from "this file type
//! just isn't extractable".
//!
//! ## Layering: parse is Core-side, the store is not
//!
//! `ryu-spaces` has zero dependency on `apps/core` and must keep it, so extraction
//! cannot move into the crate. `create_file_blocking` also runs inside
//! `spawn_blocking` while `document_parse` is async HTTP to a sidecar, so the parse
//! could not live inside that transaction even if the layering allowed it. The order
//! is therefore: **store the file, then parse, then re-chunk.** Storing first is not
//! merely convenient — the provider reads the blob *by path* (Space files reach
//! 200 MiB; the ext-proxy caps a forwarded body at 10 MiB), so the blob has to be on
//! disk before a provider can be asked about it.
//!
//! ## Failure posture: store the file, record that it is not indexed, say so
//!
//! A parse can fail for reasons that are not the user's fault and not each other:
//! no provider enabled, a sidecar that will not wake, a host with no Python, an
//! encrypted PDF, an unsupported binary. Two postures are available and both are
//! wrong:
//!
//! - **Fail the upload.** The user still wants the file stored. A `.pptx` that
//!   cannot be text-extracted is still a `.pptx` they want to download later.
//! - **Fall back to descriptor-only, silently.** This is this program's signature
//!   defect: the user believes the document is searchable, it is not, and nothing
//!   anywhere says so. It is exactly the bug being closed, one layer up.
//!
//! So: the file is **always** stored (extraction never fails an upload), and the
//! outcome is recorded in [`FileIndexStore`] as a durable per-document row. Three
//! surfaces carry it, all under the key `index` and all holding the identical
//! [`FileIndexRecord::to_json`] object, so a client needs one reader:
//!
//! - the **create** responses (`POST /api/uploads`, `POST /api/spaces/:id/files`),
//!   inline in the reply;
//! - `GET /api/spaces/:id/documents/:doc_id/index`, on demand for one document;
//! - `GET /api/spaces/:id/documents`, joined onto every `kind = 'file'` row by
//!   [`attach_index_states`] — one store read for the whole list, which is what
//!   lets a document list render searchability badges without one request per row.
//!
//! Four states, and the split between them is *what the user can do about it*:
//!
//! | state | meaning | user action |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `pending` | extraction is running (a provider job) | wait — bounded, see below |
//! | `indexed` | contents are chunked and searchable | none |
//! | `skipped` | nothing on this node can read this format | install a `document.parse` app |
//! | `failed` | something tried and could not | read `message`; retry or fix the host |
//!
//! ## `pending` is a promise, and only the provider path may make it
//!
//! `pending` is written **immediately before the background task is spawned**, so a
//! client that reads the status the instant the upload returns sees "running" rather
//! than an absent row it would have to guess about — and so that nothing else can
//! claim it.
//!
//! That second half was the bug. The row used to be written right after the file was
//! stored, ahead of *both* branches and ahead of the `index_store()` lookup's own
//! early return; when that lookup came back `None` the function returned a `pending`
//! record having started nothing at all, and no later writer existed to correct it. A
//! client polled forever and a badge said "indexing…" about work that was never going
//! to happen. A status that reports healthy-in-progress for a dead thing is the exact
//! defect this module was built to remove, so it does not get to live inside it.
//!
//! The rule the code now keeps: **a row claims `pending` only on the one path that
//! goes on to spawn**. The floor branch never writes one (it is terminal before it
//! returns), and the no-status-store case no longer suppresses the extraction it
//! cannot record — see [`mark_pending`].
//!
//! ## …and a promise nobody is left to keep is broken on read
//!
//! Writing `pending` only where something spawns is necessary and not sufficient: the
//! spawned task is the *only* writer of the terminal row, and it dies with the process.
//! A Core restart or a panicked parse task leaves a row that says "indexing…" with
//! nothing behind it, forever — the same lie the paragraph above removes, arriving by a
//! different door.
//!
//! There is no sweeper and no boot hook. A row is judged where it is read: past
//! [`STALE_PENDING_AFTER`] (the poller's own hard ceiling plus the work it does outside
//! that ceiling) a `pending` row cannot have a live poller behind it, so
//! [`FileIndexStore::record_from_row`] — which **both** readers go through, so the
//! single-document view and the list view cannot disagree — reports it as `failed` with
//! [`REASON_PENDING_ABANDONED`]. Nothing is written back; see that constant.
//!
//! ## Inline vs background — one function, two floor signals
//!
//! [`crate::document_parse::ParseSubmission`] already makes the split: the builtin
//! floor (`.txt`/`.md`/`.csv`/…) is in-process, no network, milliseconds; a provider
//! parse is a submit-then-poll job that can run for minutes. So the floor is awaited
//! inline and the file is searchable the instant the upload returns, while a provider
//! parse is spawned and reported through the status row. That is one status writer
//! ([`record_parse_result`]) reached by two entry points, not two implementations.
//!
//! The floor is reached by two *signals*, not one: the filename extension, and — for a
//! name that carries no extension at all — the declared MIME type
//! ([`crate::document_parse::mime_floor_name`]). Two of the three callers pass a
//! **title** (`notes`), not a filename, and an extension-only floor sent those to a
//! provider that could only refuse them.
//!
//! ## What is testable, and the seam that makes it so
//!
//! [`index_store`] is hard-`None` under `cfg(test)` so no test can create
//! `~/.ryu/space-file-index.db` in a live profile. The cost is that
//! [`create_file_indexed`] — which also needs a whole [`ServerState`] — cannot be
//! called in-process at all. So every decision it makes lives in a function that can
//! be: [`crate::document_parse::mime_floor_name`] (pure), [`index_on_the_floor`]
//! (takes its store and its Spaces store), [`mark_pending`] (takes its store), and
//! [`record_parse_result`] (already did). What is left in `create_file_indexed` is
//! glue that decides nothing on its own.
