//! GitHub-topic discovery source (Plugin kind, **descriptor-only**).
//!
//! Anyone can publish a Ryu app or plugin by pushing a public GitHub repo and
//! tagging it with the `ryu-app` / `ryu-plugin` topic. This source turns those
//! two topics into a browsable catalog. A THIRD topic, `ryu-marketplace`,
//! discovers community MARKETPLACES — repos hosting a `marketplace.json` whose
//! `plugins` are individual listings; each is rendered grouped under the
//! marketplace's own heading. It is deliberately the *least trusted* Plugin
//! source in the registry, and its shape encodes that:
//!
//! - **No `raw.manifest` in the install descriptor.** `resolve_plugin_from_catalog`
//!   parses `descriptor.raw["manifest"]` into a `PluginManifest` and skips a source
//!   that can't produce one — so omitting it keeps install-by-id *fail-closed*. If a
//!   future refactor "helpfully" carried the repo's `plugin.json` here, every
//!   topic-squatting repo would become an unsigned install path. The unit test
//!   `install_descriptor_never_carries_a_manifest` is the regression guard.
//! - **Every card is stamped `origin:"community"` + `reviewed:false`.** That is the
//!   one discriminator the store's trust notice keys on; see
//!   `packages/marketplace/src/catalog/apps-catalog-section.tsx` (`isCommunityEntry`).
//! - **Never lift runnable code.** Manifest enrichment in `detail` copies an
//!   allowlist of display fields only — `ui_code` / `backend_code` / `*_sha256`
//!   are dropped, mirroring the trust ladder in `gate_plugin_ui_code`.
//! - **Ids are namespaced `gh:<owner>/<repo>`.** Core's install path probes *every*
//!   registered Plugin source for *every* install-by-id, so a foreign id must be
//!   rejected in O(1), before any network call, or an unrelated install burns the
//!   GitHub Search rate-limit budget.
//!
//! "Nothing hardcoded": the API base, both topic strings, and the cache TTL are all
//! env-overridable. The BYOK personal access token is host-scoped — it is only ever
//! attached to the *default* `api.github.com` base, never to a custom one.
