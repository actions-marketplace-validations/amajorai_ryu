//! Midnight auto-wipe — a daily "fresh install" for the ISOLATED prerelease
//! profiles (`canary`, `nightly`), off by default.
//!
//! # What it does
//! On the first Core start of a new calendar day, if the user turned it on, the
//! whole profile data dir is reset to a just-installed state. It exists so a
//! canary tester exercises first-run/onboarding/migration paths every day instead
//! of accumulating months of state that no real new user ever has.
//!
//! # Why a boot-time DATE COMPARE and not a timer
//! - Not the Core scheduler: it has no cron catch-up (it short-circuits before
//!   consulting `last`), its firing state is RAM-only, and it skips every tick
//!   when entitlement is inactive. Core also dies with the desktop on a local
//!   node, so "the app was closed at midnight" is the NORMAL case, not the edge.
//! - Not a millisecond timestamp: the display timezone is a user preference in
//!   shared localStorage, and any "start of today" arithmetic is off by an hour
//!   on DST transition days. Comparing two `YYYY-MM-DD` STRINGS is immune to
//!   both: if the stored day differs from today's, a midnight passed.
//! - Several missed midnights collapse to EXACTLY ONE wipe. Replaying one wipe
//!   per missed day has no defensible meaning — the data is already gone after
//!   the first.
//!
//! # Why it reuses the node reset instead of deleting anything itself
//! [`crate::paths::request_node_reset`] + [`crate::paths::apply_pending_reset`]
//! already solve the hard parts: the delete runs at the very top of `main`,
//! before any store opens a SQLite handle; it preserves the key custody files
//! (deleting them would orphan every encrypted DB with no rekey path) and the
//! Core/gateway binaries; and it is fail-CLOSED — a blocked wipe exits(75) with
//! the marker intact rather than booting onto half-deleted state. This module
//! only ARMS that mechanism, in the same boot, one line earlier.
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT route through `data_path::clean_profile_data`, which
//! computes `home.join(".ryu{suffix}")` — the DEFAULT path. On a relocated data
//! folder (`RYU_DIR` or the pointer file) that wipes a stale default directory
//! and silently misses the live one.
//!
//! # Where the state lives, and why it is not negotiable
//! Both the flag and the last-wipe date live in `<os-config>/ryu{suffix}/`, next
//! to `data-path.json` — OUTSIDE the directory being wiped. `preferences.db` is
//! *inside* it, so a setting stored there is erased by the first wipe and reverts
//! to its default; for a default-ON setting that is an unbreakable wipe loop.
//! (We ship default OFF, so the loop cannot happen, but a user's *disable* still
//! has to survive the wipe that follows it.) localStorage is wrong for a second
//! reason: every channel ships the same bundle identifier
//! (`ai.amajor.ryu.desktop`), so localStorage is not canary-scoped at all.
