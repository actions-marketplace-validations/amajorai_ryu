//! Skill packs — a named collection of skills installable as a unit.
//!
//! A pack is either a **repo** (every `SKILL.md` directory in it is a member —
//! the "repo is a pack" model skills.sh uses for `owner/repo` pages) or a
//! **custom** user-defined pack: a manifest listing skills.sh ids
//! (`owner/repo/slug`) and parent repo URLs (`owner/repo` or
//! `https://github.com/...`). Pack members resolve to ordinary skill ids and
//! install through the existing per-skill paths, so a pack adds no second
//! install mechanism — it is a grouping over the skills the catalog already
//! knows how to fetch.
//!
//! Placement (Core vs Gateway, CLAUDE.md §1): resolving and installing skills is
//! "what runs", so packs live here in Core beside the skills catalog. Desktop,
//! web, and mobile read them through the HTTP API.
//!
//! ## Repo packs share the tap's tree walk
//!
//! Member discovery for a repo pack reuses `catalog_source::skill_registries`
//! [`GithubTapSource::skill_paths`](crate::catalog_source::skill_registries::GithubTapSource::skill_paths)
//! — the same 24h-cached recursive tree walk the GitHub tap source uses to index
//! `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directories. A pack over `owner/repo` and the tap for
//! the same repo must never disagree about what skills it contains, so they share
//! one implementation rather than two walks that could drift.
