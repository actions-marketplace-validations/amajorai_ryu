//! Language-server resolution: enabled plugin manifests → one arbitrated table.
//!
//! A plugin declares language servers in `contributes.lsp_servers`
//! ([`LspServerContribution`]) — the agent-neutral mirror of Claude Code's
//! `.lsp.json` / `lspServers`. It ships CONFIG ONLY, never the server binary.
//! This module turns every enabled plugin's declarations into ONE resolved table
//! with Claude Code's semantics already applied, so the thing that finally spawns
//! `gopls` has no arbitration left to do:
//!
//! 1. a server with invalid config is **skipped** — the others still start, and
//!    the skipped one does NOT claim its extensions, so a sibling declaring the
//!    same extension gets it;
//! 2. **first registration wins per file extension** — a later server claiming an
//!    already-owned extension loses that extension and is told who owns it;
//! 3. a server left with zero extensions after (2) is dropped, because it would
//!    have been spawned to handle nothing.
//!
//! # Why the table is resolved HERE and not at the spawn site
//!
//! The binding for the flagship `ryu` agent is the `ryu-lsp.ts` Pi extension,
//! which re-applies rule (2) over whatever it is handed. Emitting the *unresolved*
//! union and letting it arbitrate would work, but it would make the JSON object's
//! key order load-bearing across a process boundary — and `serde_json::Map` is a
//! `BTreeMap` in this build, so Core cannot express an authoring order in the first
//! place. Resolving here makes the emitted document collision-free by construction
//! (see `emitted_document_has_no_duplicate_extension_claims`), which reduces the
//! extension's own pass to a no-op and removes the ordering coupling entirely.
//!
//! # Placement
//!
//! Agent-neutral on purpose: nothing here knows about Pi. The per-agent binding
//! (materialising this table where the managed Pi's extension reads it) lives in
//! [`crate::pi_config`], and a second agent would add a second binding, not a
//! second collector. This is also why the table is NOT served from
//! `GET /api/plugins/contributions`: that endpoint is the UI plane and applies a
//! `surface` filter, and a language server gated on which shell happened to poll
//! would be a bug — Core is the consumer here, not the desktop.
