// The data-driven half of the workspace docks: turning an enabled app's
// `contributes.dock_panels[]` entries into dock tabs.
//
// Historically the two docks welded every openable panel into a closed `TabKind`
// union (`"browser" | "simulator" | …`), so shipping an app meant editing the
// shell. `dock_panels` inverts that: an app DECLARES its tab (title, icon,
// placement, order) and the shell renders it, which also means disabling the app
// removes the tab with no shell change. The shell keeps owning the panels that
// are genuinely shell infrastructure (terminal, code review, files, cowork,
// subagent, artifact, inspector, mission) — those are not apps and have nothing
// to contribute from.
//
// Everything here is PURE (no React, no fetch) so the ordering/placement/
// resolution rules are unit-testable; the rendering half lives in
// `WorkspacePanels.tsx`, which owns the native component registry.
