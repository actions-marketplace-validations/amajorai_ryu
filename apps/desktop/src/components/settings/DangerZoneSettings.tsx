// Settings → Danger Zone. Irreversible bulk "delete all X" actions for the user
// data Core holds on this node. Purely a visual layer — every delete is performed
// by Core (`/api/data/clear`, see apps/core/src/server/data_admin.rs). Each action
// is guarded by a type-to-confirm dialog and shows a live item count first.
//
// WHICH rows exist is Core's answer, not ours. This file used to carry a
// `CATEGORIES` array holding the id, title, noun, confirm word and copy of all
// five categories — a second hardcoded list that had to be edited in lockstep with
// Core's `DataCategory` enum, and that named apps (Monitors, Meetings) from the
// closed desktop source. An app now declares its own category in its manifest
// (`contributes.data_categories`) and Core serves the enabled ones with their live
// counts, so a row appears and disappears with its app and the copy lives with the
// team that owns the data.

 * theme entries). That is the wrong shape for "fresh install" and it silently
 * decayed: the desktop writes localStorage from dozens of call sites — the
 * workspace folder (`ryu_workspace_folder`), pinned dock tabs
 * (`ryu_pinned_dock_tabs`), the getting-started checklist (`ryu:getting-started`),
 * the library view, the ACP config, the agent/model selection, and a long tail of
 * unprefixed per-setting keys (`theme`, `colorTheme`, `auto-updates`,
 * `context.*`, `agent-*`, …). None of those were in the list, so after a wipe the
 * app reopened its old tabs and workspace against a node that no longer had any
 * of the underlying records. That is the "I deep cleaned and Home / my Spaces /
 * my canvas are all still there" report: the data WAS gone server-side, the shell
 * was replaying stale client state on top of it.
 *
 * An allowlist can only ever be as current as the last person who remembered to
 * append to it, and every miss looks like "the wipe didn't work". Nothing in
 * localStorage is authoritative — node identity and the node list live in Core's
 * data dir (`nodes.json`), not here — so clearing all of it loses no state that
