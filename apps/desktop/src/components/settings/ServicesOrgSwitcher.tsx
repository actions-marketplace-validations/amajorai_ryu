/**
 * The workspace picker that sits at the top of the settings dialog's SERVICES
 * group, directly above Billing.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE TABS. Billing, Referrals, Teams and Credits are
 * all ORG-SCOPED — each resolves its org from the session's active organization
 * — but not one of them printed WHICH org it was showing. A user in two
 * workspaces read four screens of numbers with no way to tell whose they were,
 * and no way to change it without leaving for the web dashboard. Putting the
 * control at the head of the group makes the scope a property of the whole
 * section rather than a fact each tab would have to repeat (and could disagree
 * about).
 *
 * SWITCHING IS A SERVER MUTATION, not local state: `set-active` rewrites
 * `activeOrganizationId` on the session row that every org-scoped route already
 * reads. That is also why the whole query cache is dropped afterwards rather
 * than a hand-picked list of keys invalidated — the switch changes the meaning
 * of every org-scoped response in flight, and enumerating them here would leave
 * the next org-scoped tab someone adds silently stale.
 *
 * BOTH CACHES, not one. The blanket invalidation used to run only against the
 * ambient client, which inside this dialog is the ISOLATED `new QueryClient()`
 * that `SettingsDialog.tsx` creates. The gateway dialog is mounted outside that
 * provider, so its workspace roster and its `gateway.configure` gate read the
 * app-wide client and stayed scoped to the previous org INDEFINITELY, not for a
 * paint. Dropping both is the only version of "everything org-scoped" that is
 * actually everything.
 *
 * Neither drop can reach the surfaces that are not queries at all — the wallet
 * balance, the auto-recharge and low-balance cards are plain state behind an
 * effect. Those re-run because `useActiveOrgId()` is one of their effect
 * dependencies, and its key is dropped here like any other. Every one of them
 * CLEARS to its empty state before it reloads, which is the rule the whole
 * change turns on: an org-scoped surface may show this org's data or nothing,
 * never the last org's while the new one is in flight.
 *
 * WHY THE ORDER BELOW. The active-org id is re-read and AWAITED before anything
 * else is touched, because it is the key half of every org-keyed query here. An
 * invalidation that runs while those queries are still mounted under the
 * PREVIOUS org's id refetches them under that id and stores the new org's answer
 * there — so switching back a minute later is served the wrong org's numbers
 * from cache, which is the exact flash the keys were added to remove.

			//    be served from them. Restricted to `inactive` for that reason (a
			//    live query must reload, not disappear) and to the DIALOG's client,
			//    whose org-keyed queries are the ones the switch strands; anything
			//    else swept here is a settings tab nobody has open, which costs one
			//    refetch when it is next opened. Safe here and not earlier: the

	//
