// The webhook-ingress decisions the Integrations tab makes, extracted so they can
// be unit-tested. `IntegrationsTab.tsx` is a React component and this repo has no
// component-test harness (the same reason `ingressLabel`/`isOwnRelayKind` live in
// `lib/api/mesh.ts`), so anything that can be *wrong* rather than merely rendered
// belongs here — this file mirrors the `plugin-composer-controls.ts` precedent.
//
// ## Why this module exists at all: a crossed request between two changes
//
// Two independently-correct changes composed into an unreachable state:
//
//   1. the desktop gained a "Public base URL" input — the ONLY in-app writer of
//      the `webhook.ingress.url` pref — rendered only while `own-relay` was the
//      *selected* backend;
//   2. Core's `POST /api/webhook-ingress/backend` (`apps/core/src/server/mod.rs`,
//      handler `webhook_ingress_set_backend`) began rejecting an `own-relay`
//      selection with **400** when neither `RYU_WEBHOOK_INGRESS_URL` nor that
//      pref holds an absolute http(s) URL (`webhook_ingress::own_relay_rejection`).
//
// `request()` throws on non-2xx, so the tab reverted the picker and the input
// disappeared again. On a node without the env var the writer of the pref sat
// behind a state the client could no longer enter: the gate was unsatisfiable
// from the UI, leaving `curl -X PUT /api/preferences/webhook.ingress.url` as the
// only route. Core's 400 is correct and stays — it is what stops the tab from
// toasting success over an ingress that can never receive a webhook. The fix is
// on this side: make the prerequisite settable BEFORE the selection that needs it.
//
// ## The dependency this file has on Core (read, not assumed)
//
// [`offersOwnRelay`] keys the input's visibility off the *offered* backends
// (`available` from `GET /api/webhook-ingress/backend`), never off the selected
// one. Today `webhook_ingress_get_backend` maps `IngressKind::ALL` with no
// filtering, so `own-relay` is always offered and the input always renders. If
// Core ever filters `available` (say, hiding backends whose prerequisites are
// missing) this shape degrades the right way — the input disappears exactly when
// the option it configures does — whereas a hardcoded `true` would strand it.

 * an implicit write on a gesture aimed at the picker could persist a half-typed
 * value AND still fail the POST, leaving two divergent states from one click.
 *
 * Both sides are trimmed, matching what the save handler actually writes — so
 * saving `" https://x "` does not leave the row permanently dirty against the
 * stored `https://x`.

 * The toast for a *successful* `POST /api/webhook-ingress/backend`.
 *
 * The branch that used to live here warned "Ingress set to … — no public URL
 * saved" whenever own-relay was selected with an empty URL field. Core's 400 gate
 * made that branch unreachable in its primary case: the POST cannot succeed for
 * own-relay unless `resolve_own_relay_base(env, pref)` yields an absolute URL. So
 * the one surviving path — success with an empty local field — is the *opposite*
 * of what it claimed: a URL exists, it just did not come from this tab. Warning
 * there would fire precisely when nothing is wrong.
 *
 * The replacement states what is knowable and no more. An empty `urlValue` is
 * evidence the pref was empty when this tab mounted, not proof of exclusivity —
 * the pref is also writable by `PUT /api/preferences/…` from outside the app — so
 * the copy names `RYU_WEBHOOK_INGRESS_URL` as the likely source without asserting
 * it is the only one. When the pref read has not resolved (`urlLoaded` false) we
 * know nothing about the field, so we fall through to the generic success, which
 * is true either way.
