// apps/desktop/src/components/settings/CapabilityProvidersSettings.tsx
//
// The non-chat half of Settings > Providers: which provider serves image
// generation, voice recognition, audio and video, plus where embeddings
// and reranking come from.
//
// # Why this is read-only
//
// Routing is EDITED in the node's Gateway settings, and this page deliberately
// does not offer a second editor. `PUT /v1/config { routing }` assigns the
// routing section WHOLESALE (`apps/gateway/src/api/config.rs`), so any save
// path that does not round-trip every field it did not touch silently erases
// the rest — that is the documented A7 defect behind
// `routingViewIncludesModalityMap`. One save path, in one place, is the whole
// mitigation; a second one here would be a new way to lose a hand-written
// `[routing.modality_map]`.
//
// So this surface answers "what serves this capability?" — which previously had
// no answer outside a node dialog most people never open — and hands editing
// back to the card that already owns it.
