// apps/desktop/src/components/gateway/AgentEgressSection.tsx
//
// "What is each of my agents actually allowed to do?" — answered as TWO
// questions, because Core asks two.
//
// Placed in the Safety filters section, directly under the command-approval
// card, because the firewall/DLP rules configured above it only ever see an
// agent whose model egress traverses the gateway. Without this list the rest of
// that section reads as node-wide policy when it is in fact per-agent opt-in for
// three of the four agent families (see `lib/api/agent-egress.ts` for the
// defaults and the mechanism each family uses).
//
// ── Why every row is two rows ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Until `agent_routing`'s split, ONE preference decided both whether Core swapped
// the agent's OpenAI base URL (moving a subscription credential and the billing
// path) and whether Core injected its MCP tool bridge (giving the agent the tool
// allowlist the user already configured for it). Declining the first silently
// removed the second, which is why a freshly installed ACP agent could not use a
// single Ryu tool.
//
// They are separate gates in Core now, and this panel's job is that they never
// look like one again:
//
//   * TWO controls per agent, each with its own badge, its own sentence and its
//     own timing caveat. Not one switch and a disclosure — one switch is what the
//     bug looked like.
//   * NO combined per-agent verdict, anywhere. There is no "Governed" pill and no
//     "N agents configured" count. Direct-with-tools and gateway-without-tools are
//     both ordinary, deliberate states; a single number over them would be read as
//     the answer and cannot be one.
//   * The two summaries are counted separately and never summed.
//
// ── Three deliberate refusals, all about not overclaiming ────────────────────
//
//  * A row shows a switch ONLY where flipping it changes what Core does. For
//    egress that means an agent Core marked `gateway_bypass` gets an explanation
//    instead of a dead control (the injection is, in Core's own words, "a genuine
//    no-op"), and the flagship Ryu row carries no egress switch because its
//    routing is a consequence of which provider the managed Pi is set to. For
//    tools it means the pi-acp family gets no switch: Core's own
//    `acp_bridge_supported` short-circuits before it ever reads the preference.
//    Note these are DIFFERENT sets of agents — `acp:gemini` can't be egress-routed
//    but takes tools fine; `acp:pi` is the exact inverse — which is why neither
//    column may be derived from the other.
//
//  * The heading and footer name the layer, repeatedly. The command-approval scan
//    (node-wide, armed by default) and plugin turn hooks are separate layers
//    again; a bare per-agent "Governed" badge would be read as a claim about all
//    of them.
//
//  * A row does not claim a state is IN FORCE the instant the preference write
//    returns — and the two halves are not stale for the same window. Egress is
//    injected into the spawn command, which is part of the ACP pool key, so a
//    changed value misses the warm instance and the chat's next message respawns.
//    The tool bridge is read once when the session is built and does NOT change
//    the pool key, so a chat with a live instance keeps its old tools until that
//    instance idles out. Each half carries its own `takesEffect` sentence from
//    `lib/api/agent-egress.ts`; do not collapse them into one.
//
// ── Why there is no live "is this agent running?" state here ──────────────────
// Because Core does not serve one, not because it could not. The live instances
// are `acp_pool()` in `apps/core/src/sidecar/adapters/acp.rs`: a private `fn`
// over a `HashMap` keyed `{conversation}\u{1}{agent}\u{1}{spawn_cmd}\u{1}{cwd}`.
// That key already encodes the spawn command an instance is running with, so Core
// can answer the exact question this badge wants — "is there a live instance for
// agent X whose spawn command disagrees with what today's preferences would
// produce?" — from data it already holds. Nothing reachable from the desktop
// exposes it: no `/api/agents` field, and `/api/sidecar/status` serves
// `SidecarManager::statuses()`, which enumerates the registered engine/system
// sidecars plus manifest-declared ones — an ACP agent is spawned by
// `run_acp_instance` and never registered with that manager, so it cannot appear
// there. The ask, if this is ever
// worth sharpening, is one additive field per agent on `GET /api/agents`
// (live instance count + whether its spawn command is the current one), after
// which `describeEgressBadge` can return the in-force state instead of hedging.
// The tool half wants a second field from the same place — whether the live
// instance was built WITH the bridge — for the same reason.
