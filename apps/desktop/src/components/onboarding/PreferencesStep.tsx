// The onboarding general-settings step. It is deliberately the same knobs the
// Settings → General / Appearance panels lead with (inset sidebar, pointer
// cursor, start-at-login) driven through the *same* setters, so whatever the
// user picks here is already persisted by the time onboarding finishes — there
// is no separate onboarding preference state to reconcile later.
//
// "Start Ryu on startup" is an OS registration (macOS LaunchAgent, Windows Run
// key, Linux ~/.config/autostart), so the OS — not a local mirror — is the
// source of truth: seed the toggle from the plugin and revert on write failure,
// exactly as the General tab does. It is the one knob here that is ON by
// default, and because there is no stored default to flip, this step performs
// the registration once on a fresh machine — see the effect below for why
// onboarding is the right (and only) place for that.
