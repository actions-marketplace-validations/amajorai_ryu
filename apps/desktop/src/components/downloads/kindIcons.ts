// One glyph per artifact family, shared by the download rows and the
// available-updates rows so the same kind never wears two different icons
// across the tray. Keyed loosely (string) because Core's `DownloadKind` and the
// desktop's `UpdateKind` overlap but are not identical — `other` is the
// fallback for anything unmapped.
