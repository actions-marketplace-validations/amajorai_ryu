// apps/desktop/src/components/marketplace/host.tsx
//
// Desktop binding for the shared @ryu/marketplace money-layer UI. Supplies the
// surface-specific services the shared components need: the owned-licenses and
// seller-status data hooks (Better-Auth bearer -> :3000), the purchase call, and
// Tauri's `openExternal` for the hosted Stripe URLs. The host is a stable module
// const so the hooks it carries keep a consistent identity across renders.
