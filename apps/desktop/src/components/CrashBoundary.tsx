// apps/desktop/src/components/CrashBoundary.tsx
//
// Renderer error boundary for the crash reporting tier (#544, P3). Wraps the app so
// an unhandled render error is (a) caught and shown a recoverable fallback instead
// of a white screen, and (b) reported to Sentry — but ONLY when the user consented
// to crash reports AND a DSN is configured (the gate lives in reportError()).
//
// This is the renderer half of the Rust panic tier in apps/core/src/crash.rs. It
// never reports prompt/agent content: only the error itself, already PII-scrubbed
// by crash.ts's beforeSend.
//
// BOUNDED SELF-RECOVERY (#60). A caught error no longer dead-ends on "Something
// went wrong". The boundary first tries to remount the failed subtree — most
// renderer crashes here are transient (a stale prop, one bad payload) and a
// remount is invisible to the user. The policy behind that lives in
// lib/crash-recovery.ts; the three rules that make it safe:
//
//   1. It is BUDGETED. The crash this was built for is React's "Maximum update
//      depth exceeded" — a render loop, which re-throws the instant it remounts.
//      MAX_AUTO_RETRIES caps the spin; after that the terminal UI renders and
//      stays. The budget is the feature, not a detail.
//   2. It is LOUD. Every attempt is reported to Sentry with its attempt number,
//      and a recovery that succeeds emits its own event. Auto-recovery that hides
//      a real bug is worse than the crash it hid.
//   3. It is OFF IN DEV (AUTO_RETRY_ENABLED). A developer must see an infinite
//      loop as an infinite loop, not as a self-healing app.
//
// The budget belongs to an *episode*, held in an instance field rather than in
// state — see the comment on `episode` for why putting it in state would silently
// unbound the retries.
