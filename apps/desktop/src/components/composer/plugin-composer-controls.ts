// The data-driven half of the composer's plugin controls
// (`contributes.composer_controls[]`).
//
// The composer used to render exactly one contributed shape — a `toggle` row in
// the "+" menu — so an app that needed a mode picker, a live pill or a one-shot
// action had to be hand-written into the shell. The manifest vocabulary is richer
// than that (`toggle` | `select` | `chip` | `action`, each with `placement` and
// `order`), and this module is where an entry is validated, placed and ordered so
// the composer can render the whole vocabulary declaratively.
//
// Pure by design (no React, no fetch): the routing rules below decide which of
// the composer's THREE existing seams an entry reaches, and each is unit-tested.
//
//   - `toggle`                     → the "+" menu's plugin rows (`pluginControls`)
//   - `select` (placement "menu")  → a composer settings-menu section
//   - `chip` / `action` / `select` (placement "bar") → the composer toolbar
//
// Nothing here forks the composer: all three seams are props of the ONE InputBar
// slot, so every surface that mounts it inherits the controls.
