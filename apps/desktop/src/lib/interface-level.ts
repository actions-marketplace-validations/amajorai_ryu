// Interface mode — how much of the app is on screen at all.
//
// Ryu ships two audiences in one binary: someone who wants a chat box, and
// someone who wants the model, the approval mode, the thinking budget and the
// raw tool transcript. Every one of those controls used to be unconditionally
// present, so the first audience met the second audience's cockpit on install.
// This is the one knob that decides which app they get, and it defaults to
// Ryu Work — the everyday, non-technical reading — because that is the larger
// audience and the one that cannot recover from a wrong default on their own.
//
// It is a binary PRESET over prefs that already exist: switching it WRITES the
// downstream prefs rather than shadowing them, so anything it turns on is still
// findable, nameable and reversible in Settings → Appearance. Two consequences
// worth stating out loud:
//
//   - Switching modes overwrites a hand-tuned Detail level. Same trade the
//     Detail preset itself makes; the alternative is a mode that claims to
//     simplify the app and then leaves the transcript exactly as it was.
//   - Transcript preferences are NEVER retro-applied on boot. `seedInterfaceLevel()`
//     writes only keys that have never been written, so an existing user's setup
//     survives the upgrade. The Ryu Work vocabulary is the one intentional
//     exception: it remains forced on whenever Ryu Work is already selected.
//
// What the level itself gates live (no write involved) is two surfaces:
//
//   - The composer: at Ryu Work the chat bar offers the agent picker and nothing
//     else — no model, no approval mode, no thinking budget, no output style.
//     See `composer-agent-controls.tsx`.
//   - The node dropdown: at Ryu Work the Engines, Voice & Sandbox and Toolkits
//     blocks start folded behind their own headings rather than listing flat.
//     See `NodeSelector.tsx`.
