// Node compatibility for the desktop.
//
// The implementation moved to `@ryuhq/core-client/node-compat` so every surface
// shares one answer. It used to live here and ONLY here, which meant the island,
// mobile, TUI, web and extension had no version awareness at all — they drove
// whatever node they were pointed at and failed in whatever way that particular
// mismatch happened to fail.
//
// Re-exported (rather than deleted) so the existing desktop call sites and this
// module's tests keep working unchanged. Behaviour is identical: a minimum-version
// floor plus capability negotiation instead of a compatibility matrix, both
// fail-soft, and every verdict advisory — the desktop and a *local* node move in
// lockstep (one release train, and a lapsed-updates install pins both), so the
// real skew is a *remote* node on its own release schedule.
