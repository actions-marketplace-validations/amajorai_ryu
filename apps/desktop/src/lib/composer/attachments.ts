//
// The ONE composer attachment seam.
//
// Every composer in the desktop — the chat page, the Ask-Ryu dock / builder panes
// (`useComposerSlot`), and the launchpad empty state — used to carry its own
// `addImages` that did the same two things: filter `files` to `image/*` and drop
// the rest. Silently. A PDF dragged into chat produced no chip, no toast, no error,
// and no request; the same drop was filtered a second time server-side. Three
// copies of one bug.
//
// This module is that logic, once. A surface wires `stageComposerFiles` into its
// picker/paste/drop handlers and renders the resulting `AttachedImage[]`; the rules
// for what is accepted, how a document becomes model-readable text, and what the
// user is told when it cannot, live here and nowhere else.

 * optimisation (it narrows the picker to what will actually work); being unable to
 * ask must not make attaching harder than it was.
 *
 * "Unable to ask" includes the answer arriving *empty of provider formats*, which is
 * the common cold-start case and the subtle one. Core deliberately does not wake a
 * lazy sidecar to answer the capability probe, so on a fresh session the bound
 * backend contributes nothing and Core replies with the builtin floor alone — a 200,
 * `available: true`, and no `.pdf`. Trusting that as the picker's `accept` (and
 * caching it) would hide PDFs behind the "+" button for the rest of the session
 * while drag and paste still worked: the original bug, wearing the button.
 *
 * So the surplus over `builtin_extensions` is the signal. No surplus ⇒ the backend
 * did not answer ⇒ union with {@link FALLBACK_ACCEPT} and do NOT cache, so the next
 * mount asks again once the sidecar is awake.
