// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/output-styles.ts
//
// Typed client for Core's output-styles API (`/api/output-styles/*`, served by the
// `ryu-output-styles` crate). An output style changes *how* an agent answers — role,
// tone, default response shape — by editing the system prompt for the turn; it never
// changes what the agent knows, which tools it has, or which model runs. The full
// contract is `docs/output-styles.md`.
//
// Field names are snake_case to match Core's serde shapes exactly, as in the sibling
// clients (meetings, skills). Two naming traps worth knowing before reading below:
//
//   - `source` on a style is its PROVENANCE (`"user"` / `"plugin"` / …), never the
//     file text. Core could not reuse `source` for raw markdown the way
//     `/api/skills/{id}/source` does, so the raw file is `raw` on every response
//     here — including the one served at `GET /api/output-styles/{id}/source`.
//   - `keep_coding_instructions` does NOT gate a Claude-Code-style engineering block
//     (Ryu has none). Per design §2 it binds to the agent's OWN base instructions:
//     `true` appends the style body after them, `false` (the default) replaces them.
