// Typed client for Core's emoji-reaction surface on a conversation's messages.
//
// The read is deliberately ONE bulk call per conversation rather than one per
// message: a long thread would otherwise open hundreds of requests to render a
// row of chips that is empty on almost every message.
//
// Identity is never sent from here. Core resolves the reacting user from the
// JWT on every write, and resolves `reacted_by_me` against that same subject on
// the read — so a client cannot react as someone else by shaping a body.
