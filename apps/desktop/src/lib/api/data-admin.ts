// Typed client for Core's "danger zone" bulk-delete endpoints (`/api/data/*`).
// All the actual delete logic lives in Core (`apps/core/src/server/data_admin.rs`);
// this is a thin visual layer. Consumed by the Settings → Danger Zone tab.

import { type ApiTarget, request } from "./client.ts";

// NOTE: the per-category counts/clear client used to live here as a hardcoded
// `DataCategory` union plus a fixed-shape `DataCounts` interface naming Monitors
// and Meetings. Both are gone: those categories are declared by the owning app's
// manifest now, so the desktop discovers them from the contributions payload
// rather than compiling the app names in. The reader lives with its only
// consumer in `components/settings/DangerZoneSettings.tsx`. Re-adding a fixed
// union here would restore exactly the hardcoding that change removed.

/**
 * Wipe this ENTIRE node back to a fresh, just-installed state — every store DB,
 * session, download, and preference (only the encryption key is preserved so the
 * node can still boot). The wipe can't run live, so Core only arms it and reports
 * `restart_required`; the caller must restart Core for the wipe to happen on the
 * next boot. `confirm` is the node name the user typed to arm the action.
 *
 * Rejected by Core (400) if `confirm` is empty, or (403) on a shared org-bound node.
