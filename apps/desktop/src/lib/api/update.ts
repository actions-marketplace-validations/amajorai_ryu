// *verdict* and the shared *auto-update toggle* (stored in the cross-surface
// preferences KV, so the same setting governs every surface). The actual
// install on desktop is performed by tauri-plugin-updater — but whether to
// surface the toast, and whether to auto-install, is decided from Core's verdict
// + this setting, so all surfaces stay consistent.
