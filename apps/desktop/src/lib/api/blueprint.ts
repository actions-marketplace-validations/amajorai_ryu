// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/blueprint.ts
//
// Typed client for the Blueprint API (`/api/blueprint/*`) — the `public_mount` Core
// serves on behalf of the `ryu-blueprint` sidecar. Field names stay snake_case to
// match the sidecar's serde shapes exactly; the desktop never renames them, because
// the companion frame reads the same JSON on the other side of the bridge.
//
// ── Why this file is ONE function ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The same reason `reasoning.ts` and `social.ts` are: Blueprint has no desktop page.
// Its whole surface is the sandboxed companion, which reaches the sidecar through the
// single generic `blueprint.request` bridge verb, so a per-endpoint client here would
// be eleven functions with no callers — and would have to grow again for the
// round-two routes.
//
// What this module does own is the fixed mount + method policy for the Blueprint
// bridge. The shared desktop-host containment check lives in `app-request.ts`;
// the independent sandbox-side check remains in `@ryu/app-host/rpc`.
//
// It is worth being concrete about who supplies the string here. A plan id is written
// by an AGENT (`plan_publish`) and appears mid-path in nearly every route
// (`/plans/:id/annotations`, `/plans/:id/steps/:step_id`). The companion concatenates
// it. So the untrusted-input path into this function is short, and it does not run
// through a human first.

 * URL parser resolves as a different HOST; a backslash, which some parsers treat as a
 * separator and others do not — the gap a traversal slips through; and anything that
 * does not RESOLVE under the mount once the WHATWG parser has had its say. That last
 * one is the important clause: matching the parser's output rather than blocklisting
 * `..` is what stops `%2e%2e` and its variants, which decode into dot segments only
