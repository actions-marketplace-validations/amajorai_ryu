// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/subtitles.ts
//
// Typed client for the Subtitles API (`/api/subtitles/*`) — the `public_mount` Core
// serves on behalf of the `ryu-subtitles` sidecar. Field names stay snake_case to
// match the sidecar's serde shapes exactly; the desktop never renames them, because
// the companion frame reads the same JSON on the other side of the bridge.
//
// ── Why this file is ONE function and not ten ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Same reasoning as `social.ts`: Subtitles has no desktop page. Its whole surface is
// the sandboxed companion, which reaches the sidecar through the single generic
// `subtitles.request` bridge verb, so a per-endpoint client here would be ten
// functions with no callers.
//
// This file owns the fixed mount + method policy and the download route's text
// response. The shared desktop-host containment check lives in `app-request.ts`;
// the independent sandbox-side check remains in `@ryu/app-host/rpc`.

/**
 * Validate a frame-supplied sub-path and return the full node path, or `null` when it

 * capability-gated forwarder is a forwarder or an SSRF hole, and it should not be
 * reachable only through a React component.
 *
 * Rejects, in order: a non-string or one not starting with `/` (which covers every
 * absolute URL and every bare-relative path); a protocol-relative `//evil/x`, which a
 * URL parser resolves as a different HOST despite passing a naive "starts with /"
 * test; a backslash anywhere, because some URL parsers treat `\` as a separator and
 * others do not; and anything that does not RESOLVE to a path under the mount.
 *
 * The last check is a PARSER, not a `..` pattern, and that is the load-bearing
 * detail. `fetch` does not read the string — it reads the WHATWG URL parser's output,
 * which treats `%2e%2e`, `%2E%2E`, `.%2e` and `%2e.` as double-dot segments and
 * collapses them. A literal-`..` blocklist therefore lets `/%2e%2e/settings` through
 * as `/api/settings`, with the host's node bearer attached (this is exactly the bug
 * the Outpost forwarder shipped and was fixed for). So: resolve with the same parser
 * `fetch` will use, assert containment, and return the NORMALIZED path — never the
 * frame's raw string — so the host and the parser cannot disagree about what was
 * requested.

 * `text/vtt`. The shared `request` helper throws on a non-JSON 200 (it reads that as
 * an SPA fallback, which for every other endpoint it is), so the download route takes
 * the raw-fetch path below rather than being papered over by loosening that check for
