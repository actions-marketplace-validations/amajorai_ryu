// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/tuition.ts
//
// Typed client for the Tuition API (`/api/tuition/*`) — the
// `public_mount` Core serves on behalf of the `ryu-tuition` sidecar. Field names
// stay snake_case to match the sidecar's serde shapes exactly; the desktop never
// renames them, because the companion frame reads the same JSON on the other side of
// the bridge.
//
// ── Why this file is ONE function ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The same reason `social.ts` is: tuition has no desktop page. Its whole surface is
// the sandboxed companion, which reaches the sidecar through the single generic
// `tuition.request` bridge verb, so a per-endpoint client here would be seven
// functions with no callers.
//
// What this module does own is the fixed mount + method policy for the Tuition
// bridge. The shared desktop-host containment check lives in `app-request.ts`;
// the independent sandbox-side check remains in `@ryu/app-host/rpc`.

 *
 * Rejects, in order: a non-string or one not starting with `/` (which covers every
 * absolute URL and every bare-relative path); a protocol-relative `//evil/x`, which a
 * URL parser resolves as a different HOST; a backslash, which some parsers treat as a
 * separator and others do not — the gap a traversal slips through; and anything that
 * does not RESOLVE under the mount once the WHATWG parser has had its say. That last
 * one is the important clause: matching the parser's output rather than blocklisting
 * `..` is what stops `%2e%2e` and its variants, which decode into dot segments only
 * AFTER a literal check would have run.
