// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/managed-bots.ts
//
// Typed client for the zero-token Telegram onboarding path ("managed bots",
// Bot API 9.6). Instead of sending the user to @BotFather to mint a token and
// paste it, Ryu's hosted MANAGER bot creates a bot the user owns and hands the
// token back to this node.
//
// Note the base-URL asymmetry with `channels.ts`, the sibling module that writes
// the resulting channel config: that one targets the identity/control plane
// (:3000, BACKEND_URL, Better-Auth session bearer) because a channel config is a
// "what is configured" record. THIS module targets the active Core NODE
// (ApiTarget/`request`, node bearer) because pairing is a node-local action: the
// node is what talks to the manager service, and the node is the only party that
// ever holds the pairing's `claim_secret`.
//
// That split is deliberate and load-bearing for security. The manager returns a
// public `nonce` (it goes into a QR the user may hold up to a camera) AND a
// `claim_secret` which is what actually authorizes redeeming the token. The
// secret never leaves Core — see {@link ManagedBotPairing}, which has no field
// for it. The desktop only ever sees nonce + deep link + status.

/**
 * Cross-unit seam, and the one place this file can silently disagree with Core:
 * these are literal paths in a different language, so nothing but a matching
 * constant couples them. Core owns the definitions —
 * `apps/core/src/server/managed_bot_api.rs` keeps them as `PAIR_ROUTE` /
 * `POLL_ROUTE` / `CONFIRM_ROUTE` and asserts their exact spelling in a test, so
 * these three lines must be read against that file, not invented here.
 *
 * The poll route is `…/managed-bot/{nonce}`, NOT `…/status/{nonce}`: Core mounts a
 * single-segment `:nonce` param, and an extra segment matches no route at all —
 * which arrives as a 404 and reads to the user as an expired link.
