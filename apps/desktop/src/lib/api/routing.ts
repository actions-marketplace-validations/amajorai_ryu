// Typed client for Core's threshold model fallback (`/api/routing/*`) — the
// rules that say "when I'm nearly out of X, run Y instead".
//
// Two surfaces, one evaluator behind them:
//
//   GET /api/routing/advice  -> what the NEXT turn would do, given current
//                               headroom. Backs the composer's info bar.
//   GET/PUT /api/routing/policy -> the node's rule list, edited in the Gateway
//                               (node) settings dialog.
//
// `advice` is a pure read — asking never applies a rule — and it is the same
// evaluator, over the same cached signals, that the turn itself runs through in
// Core. That is the point: the bar cannot promise one thing and the turn do
// another. Signal reads are cached per source in Core (subscription windows 5
// min, provider balances 5 min, the Ryu $ wallet 60 s), so calling this once per
// turn costs a preference read and arithmetic, not vendor round-trips.
