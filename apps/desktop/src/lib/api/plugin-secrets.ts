// apps/desktop/src/lib/api/plugin-secrets.ts
//
// Typed client for a plugin's WRITE-ONLY secret store (`/api/plugins/:id/secrets`).
//
// This closes the BYOK gap: a provider plugin declares an API key it needs
// (`"secret_headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer env:RYU_EXA_API_KEY"}`) but the
// declarative settings fields persist to PREFERENCES, which are readable plain
// strings — the wrong substrate for a credential. Core keeps secrets in a
// separate store and NEVER returns a stored value; the only readable state is
// "is it set, and when was it last written". Every affordance in the desktop is
// built around that: a masked input, a Save, a Clear, and a "Set · <when>"
// label. There is no reveal, because there is nothing to reveal.
//
// Field names are snake_case to match Core's serde shapes, as in every other
// client module here. Distinct from `secrets.ts`, which is the Tauri OS-keychain
// vault for first-party LLM provider keys — this one is per-plugin and lives on
// the node.
