// apps/desktop/src/lib/updates-window.ts
//
// The active account's lifetime "1 year of updates" window, mirrored locally so
// the updater can read it. A desktop licence is PERPETUAL: this window governs
// only WHICH BUILDS are offered, never whether the app runs. Nothing here may
// ever reach the paywall verdict.
//
// Why localStorage rather than the entitlement context: six independent call
// sites reach `checkForUpdate`, the launch-time updater runs before
// `useEntitlement` has resolved, and the last-known window has to survive an
// offline launch. Like `release-channel.ts`, this is a synchronous value the
// updater reads without prop-threading or awaiting an async resolve.
//
// Why the window end is stored while it is still OPEN: it is written only when
// the entitlement check succeeds. Were it written only once LAPSED, the very
// first post-lapse launch would race that check — the updater would find no key,
// send no cutoff, and auto-install one build past the ceiling. Storing it early
// and applying the lapse test at READ time removes the race at zero cost.
//
// Why every read is scoped to the active account: signing out clears the auth
// vault (`ryu_accounts` / `ryu_active_user_id`) but not this key, so an unscoped
// value would clamp the next person to sign in on the machine and show them
// billing copy about a licence they do not own. Scoping on read makes sign-out,
// full logout and account switching all correct without a single teardown call.
//
// KNOWN AND ACCEPTED — the one-launch staleness window. The record carries no
// freshness stamp, and the launch-time updater reads it synchronously before
// `useEntitlement.resolve()` has re-fetched the entitlement. So on the FIRST
// launch after an owner renews (or after they take a subscription, which exempts
// them via `updatesWindowApplies`), the previous lapsed value can still clamp
// that one check. It self-heals the moment the resolve lands and is corrected
// for every later launch. This is deliberate: the alternative is either blocking
// launch on a network round-trip, or expiring the record — which would drop the
// window exactly when an OFFLINE owner needs it, trading a one-launch clamp for
// a fail-open hole. Renewing owners can force it immediately with the Check for
// updates button in Settings, which re-reads after the resolve.
