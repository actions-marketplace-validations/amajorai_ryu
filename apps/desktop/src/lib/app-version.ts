//
// WHICH ARTIFACT AN UPDATE VERDICT IS ABOUT.
//
// Core owns the update *verdict* (`/api/update/check`) but it answers about
// ITSELF: `UpdateCheck.current` is the answering Core binary's own
// `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. That is the right answer for the Gateway dialog's Updates
// tab, which governs the node's Core/Gateway binaries — and the WRONG one for
// every surface that drives THIS APP'S bundle through `installUpdate`.
//
// The two are separate installs that routinely sit at different versions: on
// macOS the desktop downloads `ryu-core` into `~/.ryu/bin` and stamps a
// `ryu-core.version` marker beside it, so a failed or skipped re-download leaves
// an old Core answering for a new app. That is exactly the reported bug — an
// 0.1.3 app was told "Update available — v0.1.3", because the Core that answered
// was 0.0.14 and `is_newer("0.0.14", "0.1.3")` is perfectly true.
//
// So: ask Core WHETHER a release exists, then decide HERE whether it is newer
// than the running app. Same division of labour as `CheckForUpdateOptions.clamp`
// — the node supplies facts, the client owns the facts about itself.
