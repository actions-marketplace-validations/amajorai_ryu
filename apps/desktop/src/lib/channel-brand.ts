// WHAT CHANNEL THIS BUILD *IS*, AS A NAME — distinct from `release-channel.ts`,
// which holds the channel the user *chose to follow* for updates. A stable
// install can be pointed at the nightly feed; only the running bundle's own
// version says what it currently is.
//
// A build is self-describing: its version names its channel (`channelOf`,
// mirroring Core's `channel_of` in apps/core/src/update/mod.rs). This turns that
// channel id into the display name the app wears: "Research Preview" for a bare
// `0.1.4`, "Nightly" for `0.1.4-nightly.20260806.12`.
//
// The SAME table drives the OS-registered app name: `scripts/release/channel-brand.mjs`
// reads `release-channels.json` at build time and stamps `productName` into
// tauri.conf.json, so the Dock/taskbar/`.desktop` entry and any in-app label can
// never disagree — one table, not two.
