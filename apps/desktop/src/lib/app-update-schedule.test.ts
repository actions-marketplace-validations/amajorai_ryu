// apps/desktop/src/lib/app-update-schedule.test.ts
//
// Tests for the desktop's quiet-hour maths and, more importantly, for the
// PROMISE it is allowed to make. The node half of this feature says "will
// install at 03:00" and that is true of a server; a laptop is asleep at 03:00,
// so the sentence here has to be different, and the test below pins it.
//
// The DST cases are asserted as an INVARIANT SWEEP rather than two hardcoded
// nights, because the local zone is whatever the machine running the suite is
// in — a fixture pinned to Europe/Berlin would silently pass by being skipped
// everywhere else. Sweeping a full year crosses both transitions in any zone
// that has them, and still asserts something true in a zone that does not.
