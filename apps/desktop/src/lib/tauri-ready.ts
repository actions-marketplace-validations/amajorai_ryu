// apps/desktop/src/lib/tauri-ready.ts
//
// THE ready-gate for every Tauri IPC call the desktop makes. One module, not a
// guard copy-pasted per call site.
//
// Why it exists: `@tauri-apps/api` is a thin shim over `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`
// — `invoke()` is literally `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke(...)` and `listen()`
// reaches for `transformCallback` on the same object. Tauri injects that object
// into the webview, and on a cold start the React tree can mount and fire its boot
// effects BEFORE the injection lands. Every such call then rejects with a
// TypeError, and because the boot chains are `listen(...).then(...)` /
// `init().then(...)` with no `.catch`, it surfaces as an unhandled rejection.
// Production (release 0.1.11, 14 days) recorded 88 of them across three
// signatures — "reading 'transformCallback'" (66), "window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke"
// (14) and "reading 'invoke'" (8) — all early-boot, all this one bug.
//
// The shape of the fix: try the call first (zero added latency on the overwhelming
// majority of boots, where the bridge IS there), and only when it fails *because
// the bridge is missing* wait for the bridge to arrive and retry exactly once.
// So a call made too early QUEUES behind the bridge instead of throwing.
//
// Three rules this file exists to keep:
//
//  1. Only the not-yet-ready case is retried. A genuine IPC failure — the Rust
//     command returned `Err`, the command name is unknown — is detected by the
//     bridge being present at the moment of failure and propagates untouched, with
//     no retry and no swallowing.
//  2. If the bridge never arrives (a plain browser: the Playwright story harness
//     under `e2e/`, browser-mode QA), the wait is bounded by DEADLINE_MS and the
//     verdict is MEMOIZED, so N call sites cost one deadline between them rather
//     than one each. The failure is then a typed {@link TauriUnavailableError},
//     which callers catch — never an unhandled TypeError.
//  3. It must not break `apps/webapp`, which runs this same React tree in a browser
//     with `@tauri-apps/*` aliased to hand-written shims (see
//     `apps/webapp/vite.config.ts`). There `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` never
//     exists but the shimmed `invoke` works fine — which is exactly why the gate
//     ATTEMPTS the call before it ever looks at the bridge, and why "bridge
//     missing" alone is never treated as a reason to skip the call.
