// apps/desktop/src/lib/release-channel.test.ts
//
// Tests for the non-reactive release-channel read used by the updater install
// path (outside React). The validation is load-bearing: a bogus or legacy
// stored value must fall back to "stable" so an unset/corrupted install checks
// the stable feed rather than a nonexistent one. The `useReleaseChannel` hook
// (useSyncExternalStore + cross-window sync) needs a render harness and is out
// of scope for lib-only logic tests.
//
// A real DOM (localStorage) is required; register happy-dom before importing.

import { GlobalRegistrator } from "@happy-dom/global-registrator";

// `isRegistered` is the registrator's OWN state, and it is the only thing
// `register()` actually checks before throwing. The previous guard tested
// `globalThis.window`, which is a different question: bun runs every file in this
// package in ONE process, so the registrator module — and its private
// `#registered` flag — is shared across files while `globalThis.window` is not a
// reliable proxy for it. The result was "Happy DOM has already been globally
// registered" thrown from whichever file happened to be evaluated second,
// failing 25 tests across 9 files that all pass individually.
if (!GlobalRegistrator.isRegistered) {
	GlobalRegistrator.register();
