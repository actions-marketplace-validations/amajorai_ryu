// apps/desktop/src/lib/crash-recovery.ts
//
// The retry policy behind CrashBoundary's bounded self-recovery. Kept as a pure
// module (no React, no DOM, no env reads) so the part that must never regress —
// the BUDGET — is unit-testable on its own.
//
// Why a budget at all: the crash this exists for is React's "Maximum update depth
// exceeded", i.e. a render loop. Remounting the failed subtree fixes the transient
// cases (a stale prop, a one-off bad payload) but re-enters the loop for a real
// one, so an unbounded retry would spin forever and burn the user's battery while
// showing them nothing. Every retry is therefore spent from a fixed budget, and
// when it runs out the terminal error UI renders and stays.
//
// An "episode" is one crash and everything that follows from it. A later, unrelated
// crash must get its own full budget — otherwise a single early hiccup permanently
// disarms recovery for the rest of the session — so an episode ends when the user
// moves to a different route, or when the boundary has rendered cleanly for
// STABLE_RENDER_MS (see CrashBoundary.confirmRecovered).
