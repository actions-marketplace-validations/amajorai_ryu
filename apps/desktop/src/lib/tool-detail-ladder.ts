// The Detail level ladder: the pure rules behind Appearance → Chat → "Detail
// level". Lives in its own module (and not inside AppearanceTab.tsx) because the
// custom-parking arithmetic is the piece that silently regresses the moment
// someone adds a detent, and it is only checkable if it can be imported without
// dragging in React and the whole settings tab.
//
// The "Tool detail" knob is a stepped preset over the four transcript-density
// toggles (group / expand file edits / expand commands / expand code blocks):
// one simple choice that most users never outgrow, with the individual toggles
// tucked into "Advanced" for anyone who wants to fine-grain. The preset is
// DERIVED from the toggles (no separate storage), so editing an individual
// toggle in Advanced simply lands on whichever preset matches — or "custom" when
// none does. Ordered by how much each surfaces: compact (all collapsed) →
// minimal (diffs open) → detailed (everything open, calls listed individually).
// `pinUserMessage` is intentionally NOT part of this — it is scroll behaviour,
// not detail.
//
// `code` was added after the fact and only Detailed turns it on, so the two
// levels a user is most likely to be sitting on (Compact is the default, Minimal
// the common step up) keep matching their preset across the upgrade. Someone
// already on Detailed lands on "custom" once — the slider still shows where they
// are and one nudge puts them back on a named level, which is why nothing
// silently rewrites their toggles to make the label tidy.
//
// "None" is the exception to "derived from the four toggles", and it has to be:
// all four govern EXPANSION, and no combination of them can say "not shown at
// all". So it is a fifth, separate pref (`ryu:hide-tool-detail`) that
// SHORT-CIRCUITS the derivation — at None the other four are still stored
// exactly as the user left them, they simply have nothing to expand. That is
// also why picking None writes only that one flag: step back up to any other
// level and the toggles come back as they were, instead of having been quietly
// rewritten while the ladder was at the bottom.
