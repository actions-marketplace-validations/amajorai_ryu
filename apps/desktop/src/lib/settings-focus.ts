// The handoff between a settings SEARCH RESULT and the row it names.
//
// Clicking a result has to do two things that happen at different times: switch
// the dialog to the owning section (synchronous), and then scroll to + highlight
// the row (only possible once that section has mounted, which may be a few
// frames later, or a few hundred ms later for a pane that fetches first).
//
// So the click leaves a one-shot "reveal this" request here, and the content
// pane picks it up after it renders. If the row never appears — a row behind a
// disclosure, a pane that failed to load — the user still ends up on the right
// section, which is the outcome the old tab-only search gave at best.
//
// Anchoring is by `data-setting-id` when a row carries one, falling back to the
// row's visible title text. The fallback is the common path on purpose: threading
// an id through several hundred existing rows would be a large mechanical diff
// for no user-visible gain, and the index stores labels verbatim precisely so the
// text match is exact rather than fuzzy.
