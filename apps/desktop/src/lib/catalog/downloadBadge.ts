//
// What a download row's type badge says. Pure and framework-free (rendered by
// DownloadTypeBadge), so the vocabulary is unit-testable and shared by the tray
// and the full page.
//
// Why a badge and not more label text: the download center mixes engines,
// weights, adapters, tool binaries and unpack steps, and the only thing that used
// to distinguish them was a parenthetical some call sites bothered to append —
// "nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (embedding model)" got one, "whisper.cpp" and
// "OuteTTS" got nothing, and Kokoro sent the same string for two different files.
// Core now tags every task with a structured `role`; this maps that to one short
// word so the *type* reads at a glance and the label is free to be just the name.
//
// `role` is authoritative. The `kind` fallback only covers tasks written by an
// older Core (which deserialize as `other`) and the label heuristic only refines
// a generic model into a draft/vision companion, which the catalog install path
// cannot know before it reads the filename.
