// apps/desktop/src/lib/sidebar/date-buckets.ts
//
// The sidebar's ChatGPT-style date buckets, as a primitive ANY list can use.
//
// This started life as three module-private helpers inside `AppSidebar.tsx`,
// hardcoded to `Conversation` and reachable only from the Chats section. That made
// "group by date" a property of one list rather than of the sidebar, so every other
// list that grew rows over time — a project's chats, a space's pages, the Uploads
// space's files, an app-registered section's feed — had no way to opt in short of
// copying the bucketing. Hence the generic `stampOf` accessor: the buckets know
// nothing about what they hold, and a caller supplies the one field that carries
// time (`updatedAt` for a chat, `createdAt` for a space document, whatever an app's
// feed names it).
//
// Deliberately dependency-free and pure: `startOfToday` is a REQUIRED argument
// rather than a `startOfTodayMs()` call inside, because the boundary depends on the
// user's chosen display zone and the caller is what re-reads it (see
// `useTimezoneRevision`). Keeping the clock outside is also what makes this unit
// testable without faking a zone.
