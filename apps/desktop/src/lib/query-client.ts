// App-wide TanStack Query client. Catalog data (models, skills) changes slowly,
// so we keep a generous staleTime — revisiting a model you already opened is then
// instant (served from cache) instead of refetching from Core/Hugging Face on
// every navigation. Window-focus refetch is off by DEFAULT because this is a
// desktop shell, not a dashboard that needs to chase live data; the few queries
// that must chase it (git status / worktree state — see `useGitStatus.ts`) opt
// back in per query.

import { observeQueryFocus } from "./query-focus.ts";

// Native window blur/focus and browser visibility both matter: without the
// false transition, every interval continues polling in the background and
// returning to a stale query cannot reliably trigger a fresh focus event.
