// apps/desktop/src/lib/app-update-schedule.ts
//
// Deferring THIS APP'S OWN update to the machine's next quiet hour.
//
// The sibling of `scheduleNodeUpdate` in `lib/api/update.ts`, and deliberately
// NOT the same thing. That one defers a REMOTE node's update: it POSTs to that
// node's Core, the quiet hour is computed in the NODE's zone, and the node's own
// 30s tick installs it. This one defers the desktop bundle, so the machine that
// restarts is this one, the zone is this machine's, and the record is local.
//
// WHAT WE MAY PROMISE, AND WHY IT IS NOT "AT 03:00". A node is a server: it is
// awake at the quiet hour, so "installs at 03:00" is true there. A laptop is
// asleep, or quit, or both, and nothing in this bundle registers a wake or a
// calendar launch — `tauri-plugin-autostart` registers launch-at-LOGIN, not
// launch-at-a-TIME. So the truthful sentence is "the next time you open Ryu
// after 03:00", with an immediate install if the app happens to be running and
// awake when the window arrives. `describePendingAppUpdate` is the one place
// that sentence is written, so no surface can accidentally promise more.
//
// THE QUIET HOUR IS COMPUTED HERE, NOT IN RUST. The Tauri crate has no timezone
// database (no `chrono-tz`), and it does not need one: unlike a node, this
// machine's own local time IS the relevant zone, which the platform already
// knows. So this file resolves an absolute instant and Rust stores it — a plain
// wall-clock number, immune to a DST change between booking and the window.
