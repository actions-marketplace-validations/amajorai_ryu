// The updater pubkey baked into `tauri.conf.json` MUST be the public half of the
// minisign key that CI signs releases with (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` on the
// PUBLIC repo, whose public half is committed as `.tauri/ryu-updater.key.pub`).
//
// This drifted once and broke auto-update for every user across v0.1.5 → v0.1.12:
// somebody ran `tauri signer generate` locally, pasted the new public key into the
// conf, and set the PRIVATE repo's secret — while the public repo (the one that
// actually builds and publishes the release assets) kept signing with the original
// key. Every shipped `.sig` then failed verification with
// "the signature was created with a different key than the one provided", and
// because the private half of the pasted key never left that laptop the mismatch
// could only ever be fixed forward.
//
// A mismatch here is unrecoverable in the field — clients verify with the key baked
// into the build they already installed — so it has to fail before the release, not
// after.
