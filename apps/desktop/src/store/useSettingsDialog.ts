// SettingsDialog.tsx) so external openers — the Gateway dialog cross-link, the
// command palette, deep links — can request a specific section without
// importing the dialog component (which would pull the whole settings UI into
// those entry points). Mirrors useGatewayDialog.ts.
// Desktop-client / user-account sections only. Node-level tabs (meetings, memory,
// privacy, storage, email-alerts, connections, health, predict, tasks) and the
// Danger Zone moved to the Gateway dialog (see `GatewaySection`); per-app/plugin
// user-scoped tabs are dynamic and use `app:<id>` / `plugin:<id>` values. The
// Island and Shadow tabs (node-scoped sidecar apps) are dynamic too — each
// declares a manifest `contributes.settings_tabs` view and renders in the Gateway
// dialog under the Apps/Plugins headers, so neither has a static value here.
// `updates` here is the *desktop app's own* updater — the Gateway dialog keeps a
// separate Updates tab for the node's Core/Gateway binaries.
