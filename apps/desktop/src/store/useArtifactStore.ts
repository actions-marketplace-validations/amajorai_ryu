// apps/desktop/src/store/useArtifactStore.ts
//
// The in-memory home for artifacts opened as WORKSPACE (window) tabs. A window
// tab addresses an artifact by path (`/artifact/<id>`); the id is only stable
// for the session, so a tab opened on one and restored later resolves to
// nothing and the page says so — the same "no longer available" contract the
// dock's artifact tab already uses. Artifacts here are minted by the agent's
// inline artifact surface before the tab opens, so `put` always precedes
// `openTab("/artifact/...")`.
