// apps/desktop/src/hooks/useSidebarModes.ts
//
// The sidebar arrangements currently on offer: the shell's own, plus any an
// enabled app contributes via `contributes.sidebar_modes`.
//
// A hook rather than a helper each surface calls with its own inputs, because two
// surfaces offer the list — the sidebar's own context menu and the Appearance tab
// — and they must offer the SAME one. The section-resolution rule
// (`contributedSidebarModes` drops names this shell has no section for, and drops
// a mode left with none) is the part that would drift: a settings page listing a
// mode the sidebar refuses to enter is worse than not listing it.
