// apps/desktop/src/hooks/useAgentCapabilities.ts
//
// Loads the active agent's effective capabilities (tools / reasoning / vision)
// so the composer and the agent edit page can render controls conditionally,
// the Jan way: a model that can't call tools shows no tools affordance, a
// non-reasoning model shows no thinking control. Cached per (node, agent); only
// fetched when an agent id is present. Every decision lives in Core
// (`GET /api/agents/:id/capabilities`).
