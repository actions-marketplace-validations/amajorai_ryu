// apps/desktop/src/hooks/useGitStatus.ts
//
// The single source of truth for "what does git say about this folder" in the
// desktop. Every surface that shows a branch, a dirty dot, or a +/− count reads
// it from here, so they can never disagree with each other.
//
// Before this hook each consumer (the branch picker, the worktree picker, the
// unified WorkspacePicker that has since replaced both, and PinnedSummaryPanel)
// called `fetchGitStatus` from its own
// effect on its own schedule: two of them polled every 5s from independently
// started timers, two fetched exactly once and then never again. That is why the
// numbers drifted — not because any one of them was wrong, but because they were
// each right about a different moment.
//
// The cache key is the working directory, canonicalised. Branch is *output*, not
// part of the key: keying on folder+branch would mint a fresh entry on every
// checkout and leave the old one behind, still holding the numbers from before
// the switch. A git worktree is not a third axis either — it is simply a
// different working directory, so `~/proj` and `~/proj/.claude/worktrees/foo`
// are two keys, which is correct.
//
// ── When these queries re-read git, and why ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Three triggers, in order of how much of the problem each one actually solves:
//
//  1. **Window focus.** To run git OUTSIDE Ryu — commit, reset, checkout, pull —
//     the user has to leave this window and come back. So focus is not a
//     heuristic here, it is the exact event: every out-of-app change is followed
//     by a focus, and every focus is cheap (one read per open folder). The
//     app-wide client sets `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` (right for slow-moving
//     catalog data), so each query below opts back IN explicitly. Without this
//     the number stayed whatever it was when the user tabbed away — the "silently
//     wrong for hours" failure. Note this only works because `query-client.ts`
//     teaches TanStack what focus means on a desktop: out of the box v5 watches
//     `visibilitychange` alone, which a cmd-tab away from a still-visible window
//     never fires.
//  2. **Explicit invalidation** after anything Ryu itself does: checkout, branch
//     create, commit/push, worktree apply, and the end of an agent turn (the
//     moment a run's edits have all landed). See `invalidate*` below.
//  3. **A slow poll**, as a safety net only, for changes no one announced (a
//     background `git gc`, an editor writing files, a long agent run mid-flight).
//     15s, not 5s: one read is 3-4 `git` subprocesses against the whole worktree,
//     it runs per open folder for as long as the app is up, and (1)+(2) already
//     cover every case a human would notice. TanStack pauses the interval while
//     the window is unfocused, so an idle background app polls nothing at all.
//
// What is deliberately NOT a trigger: typing, rendering, or any per-keystroke
// event. Git status is a process spawn, not a state read.
