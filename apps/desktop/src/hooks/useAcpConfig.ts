// Loads the active agent's ACP session config (permission modes / reasoning
// effort / models) so the composer can render per-agent pickers, exactly the
// data-driven way Zed does it. Cached per (node, agent); only fetched when an
// agent id is present. Non-ACP agents return all-null and simply show no
// pickers. Every decision lives in Core (`/api/agents/:id/acp-config`).
