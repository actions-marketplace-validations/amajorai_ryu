// Core at `GET /api/plugins/contributions`) and the shell's theme picker.

// contributes one, the same shape VS Code and Zed use. That means a theme
// inherits install / uninstall / enable, versioning, signing, the Store detail
// page and the trust scorecard without any of it being rebuilt for themes.
//
// This hook is the ONE side-effecting reader: it mirrors the served set into the
// localStorage cache that `findVariant` / `initTheme` resolve against. Those run
// before React mounts and before any node is reachable, so a plugin theme that
// existed only in a react-query cache would flash the wrong preset on every cold
// start and be unresolvable entirely while offline.
