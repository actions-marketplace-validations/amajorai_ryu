// The two bulk actions on the download center — "Clear finished" and "Clear
// unfinished" — shared by the tray popover and the full downloads page so the
// same words do the same thing in both places.
//
// This exists because the popover's version was fire-and-forget: it issued a
// DELETE per finished task, swallowed every rejection with `.catch(() =>
// undefined)`, and waited on Core's `removed` SSE event to update the list. Three
// ways that reads as "the button does nothing":
//
//   1. Core's `clear` is a no-op for a row that is not terminal, and answers
//      `{ok:false}` rather than an HTTP error — so a silent false was
//      indistinguishable from success.
//   2. A failing request (node unreachable, 401) was swallowed with no toast, no
//      log, and no change on screen.
//   3. Even on success, the durable history log kept its own copy, so the
//      downloads page's History section was untouched. There was no route to
//      clear it at all until `clearDownloadHistory`.
//
// So: await every call, drop the rows locally instead of waiting on the stream,
// clear the durable log as part of "finished", and report a failure out loud.
