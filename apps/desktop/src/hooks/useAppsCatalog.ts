// Backs the Store "Apps" section. Unlike the model/skill catalogs, an app row
// has three lifecycle states (install / enable / disable), and the registry
// catalog carries only discovery metadata — no installed/enabled flags. So this
// hook fetches BOTH the catalog and the live app records (`/api/apps`, `AppInfo[]`)
// and joins them by `id`: the matched AppInfo is the source of truth for installed/enabled
// state and the grants to confirm at enable time. Mutations (install / enable / disable /
// install-from-URL) revalidate both queries so the buttons update in place.
//
// Catalog browsing is source-aware: "Ryu Marketplace" (default) is one UNIFIED
// view Core merges from the open git catalog, the hosted commerce server's paid
// listings, the loaded built-ins and the legacy registry; federated sources
// (integrations.sh) use server-side search + pagination. Both go through
// `/api/plugins/catalog/browse`, and the source rides on the REQUEST (`?source=`)
// rather than a node-global preference — see `sourceOverride` below.
