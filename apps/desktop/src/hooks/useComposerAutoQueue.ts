//
// "Don't start this now — the machine is already full."
//
// When `auto_queue_enabled` is on and the node is already running `max_concurrent`
// agents, pressing send does not send: the message becomes a draft armed with
// `concurrency { below: max_concurrent }`, and `useDraftsDispatcher` starts it the
// moment a slot frees. Off by default, because this changes what pressing Enter
// does and a user who has not asked for a queue should get the send they pressed
// for.
//
// The running count is read at SUBMIT time, not cached from the dispatcher's tick.
// A send happens a few times a minute at most, so one request buys a reading that is
// actually current — and a stale "2 running" from nine seconds ago is exactly how a
// message gets sent into a node that just filled up.
//
// Fail-OPEN here, which is the opposite of the dispatcher's rule and deliberate: if
// the running count cannot be read, the message SENDS. The user pressed send; the
// worst case of sending is a busy node, while the worst case of swallowing it into a
// queue on an unreadable signal is that their message silently does not happen.
