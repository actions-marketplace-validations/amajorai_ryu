 * why "the editor AI is broken" was believable enough to reach a blocker register

 * encode (`apps/core/src/profile.rs` `port(7980)`, `apps/gateway/src/profile.rs`
 * `port(7981)`): **the Gateway is Core's port plus one, on every profile.** So
 * the offset never has to be known here — the node URL already carries it.
