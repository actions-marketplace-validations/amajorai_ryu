// Kept in its own module (like `registry.ts`, and unlike the rest of `builtins.ts`)
// because it is pure input → output: no React, no page imports, so `builtins.test.ts`
// can assert it without dragging the whole desktop page graph into the test runner.

 *   2. **Companion id** — `app__<slug>-companion` answers to `/<slug>`. Covers every
 *      built-in short path whose name matches its app (`/calendar`, `/timeline`, …).
 *
 * There is deliberately no third "match the display name" tier: a path that resolves
 * off a translatable label breaks the moment someone retitles a button. The two
 * legacy paths no app can derive from its id (`/inbox` → the approvals app,
 * `/skills/new` → the skill editor) are spelled out where they are registered, and
 * still name a PATH rather than a companion id so they blank out when disabled.

 * the route then renders blank instead of a stale companion frame.
