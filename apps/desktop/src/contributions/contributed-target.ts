// apps/desktop/src/contributions/contributed-target.ts
//
// The ONE place a contributed route template (`sidebar_sections[].spec.itemTarget`,
// `sidebar_buttons[].target`) is turned into an `openTab` call.
//
// Why it exists: a tab is `(path, options)`, and some destinations live entirely in
// the options half. A conversation is the case that matters — the shell opens one
// with `openTab("/chat", { conversationId })`, and `builtins.ts` registers only the
// exact route `/chat`, so there is NO path a manifest can name that opens a specific
// thread. Without this, an app could list runs in the sidebar but clicking a row
// could only ever land on a blank composer.
//
// The mapping is a strict ALLOWLIST, and that is the security-relevant part. The
// `openTab` options bag also carries `initialPrompt` / `initialSubmit`; spreading
// parsed query parameters into it would let a manifest — text, not code, and
// therefore not something the sandbox review path scrutinises for behaviour — hand
// the user a row that SENDS a message to their agent on click. Only the keys listed
// in {@link CONTRIBUTED_TARGET_PARAMS} cross over; everything else is dropped, and
// the query string is stripped from the path either way (`openTab` keys tabs on the
// bare path, so a stray query would also defeat its reuse/dedup).
