// The one place the chat composer's LEFT control cluster is defined.
//
// ChatPage, the launchpad (empty-tabs home), and the Ask Ryu dock all render the
// exact same bar — a single `ComposerSettingsMenu` (Agent · Model · … one trigger,
// sections inside), then read-only `CapabilityBadges`, then the subscription
// `UsageBar` — because every one of them gets it from this hook. Before this, each
// surface re-derived the mode list and re-wired the ACP hide / team-prefix / create
// sentinel by hand, and only ChatPage bolted on the badges + usage meters, so the
// launchpad and dock silently drifted into a lighter, different-looking bar. This
// module is that derivation once, so the three surfaces read identically and can
// never drift apart again.
//
// `useComposerAgentModes` builds the `ModeOption[]` from the live registry;
// `useComposerAgentControls` returns `{ leftActions, rightActions, sections }` — the
// first two a host spreads straight into `InputBar` (`rightActions` is always `null`
// — model lives in the settings menu), and `sections` the composed Agent · Model ·
// Thinking list so a surface with its own trigger (the empty-state agent logo) can
// open the IDENTICAL dropdown via `ComposerSettingsMenu`'s `trigger` prop. It is
// controlled — the caller owns the agent/team/model
// selection state (localStorage on the launchpad, a `BuilderRuntime` in the dock,
// ChatPage's own state) — and surfaces with a richer picker (ChatPage's ACP model
// chain + approval/config sections) feed those in via `modelSection`/`extraSections`.
// The capability badges + usage meters are derived from `agentId` inside the hook, so
// every surface that names an agent gets them for free.
