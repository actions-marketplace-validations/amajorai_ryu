//! A desktop-app update the user asked to have installed later, and the only
//! place that record is stored.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM CORE'S. `apps/core/src/update/schedule.rs`
//! defers a NODE's update: a server that is genuinely up at 03:00, whose own
//! 30s scheduler tick applies the record. This is the other half of the same
//! idea for the app bundle, and the difference in what can be PROMISED is the
//! whole design:
//!
//!   * A node is awake at the quiet hour, so "installs at 03:00" is true there.
//!   * A laptop is asleep, or quit, or both. Nothing in this bundle registers a
//!     calendar or wake launch — `tauri-plugin-autostart` is launch-at-LOGIN,
//!     not launch-at-a-TIME — so the app cannot promise to be running then.
//!
//! So the honest promise is "the next time you open Ryu after the window", with
//! an immediate install if the app does happen to be running and awake at the
//! hour. `due_at` is a WALL-CLOCK comparison for exactly that reason: a
//! monotonic timer does not advance across system sleep, so only comparing the
//! stored instant against the current time survives a closed lid. Late is fine;
//! never is not.
//!
//! WHERE THE RECORD LIVES, and the two directories it must not be in — the same
//! reasoning as `midnight_wipe.rs`:
//!
//!   * NOT `profile::ryu_home_dir()` (`~/.ryu{suffix}`). That is Core's data
//!     dir, and Core's own record is `ryu_dir().join("pending-update.json")`. A
//!     desktop record there would collide with Core's on a local node — two
//!     different deferrals, one file, and whichever wrote last wins.
//!   * NOT localStorage. Every channel ships the same bundle identifier
//!     (`ai.amajor.ryu.desktop`), so a webview store is shared with the stable
//!     install rather than scoped to canary — and it is also inside the folder
//!     the midnight wipe deletes.
//!
//! So: a small JSON file in the OS config dir, profile-suffixed, with a
//! basename that cannot be confused with Core's.
