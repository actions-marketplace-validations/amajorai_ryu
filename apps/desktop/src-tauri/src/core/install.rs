//! Production-only auto-install of the out-of-process Ryu sidecar binaries from the
//! public download hub (amajorai/ryu) into `~/.ryu/bin/`. In dev the binaries are
//! owned by turbo (`bun run dev:core` / `dev:gateway`), so this path never runs
//! there — `lib.rs` gates every call on `not(debug_assertions)`.
//!
//! The binaries are resolved by Core the same way (env override else bare command
//! name on a PATH that includes `~/.ryu/bin`), split into two policy classes:
//!
//! **Required (loud on failure):**
//!   - `ryu-core`     — the orchestration engine (auto-installed since day one).
//!   - `ryu-gateway`  — the control layer Core spawns as a managed sidecar.
//!                      Core hands every model call to it (`sidecar/gateway.rs`,
//!                      `DEFAULT_GATEWAY_BIN = "ryu-gateway"`, resolved on PATH). Nothing
//!                      installed it before this module — that was the real gap.
//!
//! **App sidecars (opt-in feature backends) are NOT installed here.** This desktop
//! layer only fetches the two required bins above. Each apps-store app's `ryu-<app>`
//! binary (mail/teams/research/clips/finetune/quests/healing/meetings/recipes/
//! dashboards/monitors) is downloaded by **Core on-demand the first time the app is
//! enabled**, and removed on uninstall — tying the binary to the app lifecycle
//! instead of a blanket boot-prefetch. See
//! `apps/core/src/sidecar/manifest_sidecar.rs` (`ensure_local_sidecar_present` /
//! `remove_local_sidecar_binaries`) and `plans/019-sidecar-binary-lifecycle.md`.
//! (`ryu-browser` is an Electron bundle, never a single-file spawnable, and still
//! resolves only when already on PATH via `RYU_BROWSER_BIN`.)

// and it installs into its OWN directory (`~/.ryu/island/`, kept apart from the
// `~/.ryu/bin/` sidecars so the bundle — a whole `.app` on macOS — never mingles
// with the flat command binaries). So it gets a dedicated resolver + installer +
// launcher below rather than an entry in the sidecar tables.
//
// The tray already drives an *already-running* island through its loopback
// control server (`tray::island_control`); this module supplies the missing
// "download it and start it in the first place" half. Island self-guards with an
// Electron single-instance lock (`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` in
// `apps/island/src/main/index.ts`), so a redundant `launch_island` on a restart
// where island is already up self-exits — the launch path can stay unconditional.

/// The dedicated install directory for Island: `~/.ryu/island/`. Separate from the
