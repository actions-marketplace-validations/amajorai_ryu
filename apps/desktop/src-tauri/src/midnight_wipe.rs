//! The desktop half of the midnight auto-wipe: the one place the user's choice
//! is stored, and the only place it may be written.
//!
//! Core owns the behaviour (`apps/core/src/midnight_wipe.rs`) — it arms the node
//! reset at boot when a calendar day has turned. This module owns the SETTING,
//! because the setting has to live somewhere both sides can see and the wipe
//! cannot destroy:
//!
//!   * NOT `preferences.db` — that file is INSIDE the directory being wiped, so a
//!     user's "turn this off" would be erased by the next wipe it failed to stop.
//!   * NOT localStorage — every channel ships the same bundle identifier
//!     (`ai.amajor.ryu.desktop`), so a webview store is shared with the stable
//!     install rather than scoped to canary.
//!
//! So it is a small JSON file in the OS config dir, next to `data-path.json`,
//! profile-suffixed exactly like Core's `paths::config_dir()`. Core reads it; this
//! side writes `enabled` and never touches `last_wipe_date`.
//!
//! The write path is fail-closed in the direction that matters: a profile that
//! cannot be wiped (release, dev, beta — anything not canary/nightly) cannot have
//! the flag ENABLED at all. Turning it off is always allowed.
