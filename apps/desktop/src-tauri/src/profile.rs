//! Desktop build/runtime profile — the client mirror of Core's `profile.rs`.
//!
//! A *profile* lets a **dev variant** of the desktop ("Ryu Dev") run FULLY
//! ISOLATED alongside a release install on one machine: a distinct Core port, a
//! distinct data dir (`~/.ryu-dev`), and a distinct island control port, so the
//! two stacks never bleed into each other. The distinct bundle identifier
//! (`ai.amajor.ryu.desktop.dev`, set in `tauri.dev.conf.json`) gives it its own
//! single-instance lock and app-data store for free.
//!
//! This MUST agree with `apps/core/src/profile.rs`: dev shifts every base port by
//! [`DEV_PORT_OFFSET`] (1000) and suffixes the data dir with `-<profile>`. The
//! desktop passes `RYU_PROFILE` to the Core child it spawns (see
//! `core/process.rs`), and Core's own profile module then binds the shifted port
//! and uses the shifted data dir — so there is one offset convention on both
//! sides and they can never disagree.
//!
//! The active profile comes from, in order: the `RYU_PROFILE` env var, else the
//! `dev-variant` compile feature (the packaged "Ryu Dev" build), else **the
//! channel this build's own version names** ([`profile_for_version`]), else
//! release. A stable-versioned release build with none of those is
//! **byte-identical to before**: port 7980, `~/.ryu`, the original bundle id.
//!
//! That third step is what makes a canary/nightly bundle an isolated stack. The
//! profile table below has carried `canary` and `nightly` rows since it was
//! written, but NOTHING ever activated them: only `dev` had a switch, so a
//! canary build fell through to `release` and ran against `~/.ryu` — the same
//! data folder as the user's stable install, sharing its port, its keychain slot
//! and its DBs. `scripts/release/bump-version.sh` stamps
//! `0.1.12-canary.20260813.36` into every Cargo.toml, so `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`
//! already carries the channel; reading it here is the whole activation.
//!
//! Every profile has its OWN port offset ([`PROFILE_PORT_OFFSETS`]). This used to
//! be "release ⇒ 0, anything else ⇒ dev's +1000", which gave `canary` its own data
//! dir and keychain slot but dev's listeners — two stacks that each believed they
//! were isolated while sharing one port.
