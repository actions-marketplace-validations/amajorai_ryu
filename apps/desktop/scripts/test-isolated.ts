// Runs every test file in its OWN bun process.
//
// Required for this package for the same reason `packages/api` needs it, but a
// different global: happy-dom. Nine suites call `GlobalRegistrator.register()`,
// which replaces `window`, `localStorage`, `Response`, `ReadableStream` and
// `TransformStream` on `globalThis` for the WHOLE process — and `bun test`
// imports every file before running any test, so those swaps land before the
// first assertion regardless of file order.
//
// The failures that produced were all of the "passes alone, fails in the suite"
// kind, which is the expensive kind to chase:
//   - a file stubbing `window` left every later file without `dispatchEvent`;
//   - `globalThis.localStorage = …` threw "assign to readonly property" once any
//     sibling had registered happy-dom;
//   - `instrumentedFetch` piped a bun-native `Response.body` into a happy-dom
//     `TransformStream` and died on "readable should be ReadableStream", purely
//     because an unrelated sibling had registered first.
//
// Per-file processes remove the shared global entirely, so no suite has to
// defend against what its neighbours install.

// profile's port 8980; `bun test <file>` run directly resolves it to test and
// loads `.env`, which uses the release port 7980. That single variable decides
// what `isLocalNode` considers local, so under the wrong one a fixture node at
// 127.0.0.1:7980 stops looking local, gets probed as a remote, and
// `useNodeStore`'s auto-selection assertions invert.
//

// isolated run identical to running any single file by hand, instead of leaving
// the answer to how the script happened to be launched.
