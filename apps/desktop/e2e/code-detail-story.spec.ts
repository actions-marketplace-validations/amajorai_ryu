// Real-browser spec for the code-detail story (`e2e/harness/
// code-detail-story.{html,tsx}`), which renders the REAL `Markdown` with a
// 300-line fenced block under both values of the `expandCodeBlocks` chat-display
// pref.
//
// The contract under test: Settings → Appearance → Detail level reaches code
// blocks, not just tool calls. Below the Detailed level a long block is CAPPED
// AND SCROLLABLE — capped so one paste cannot bury the rest of a reply, scrollable
// because code the model wrote must never become unreachable. At Detailed it is
// uncapped.
//
// This is a selector-matching test as much as a behaviour one: the cap is a CSS
// rule aimed at `@streamdown/code`'s own `data-streamdown` parts, so a plugin
// upgrade that renames or re-nests them fails here rather than silently reverting
// every user to full-height code.
