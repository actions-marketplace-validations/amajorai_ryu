// Standalone browser story for MESSAGING-STYLE SENDER RUNS in the real
// transcript — consecutive user messages with no reply between them draw one
// avatar, on the row that closes the run, and sit tighter than unrelated turns
// (`userRunPositions` in `packages/blocks/src/desktop/agent-elements/
// message-list.tsx`, `groupPosition` in `user-message.tsx`).
//
// This fixture exists because NO other one contains two consecutive user
// messages. `chat-scroll-story.tsx` and `chat-date-groups-story.tsx` are both
// strict user/assistant alternations, so every turn there is a run of one and
// the grouping code is entirely untested by them — a collapsed avatar gutter or
// an inverted first/last would pass both of those suites.
//
// Why a real browser: the load-bearing claim is a LAYOUT claim. Omitting the
// avatar on a non-closing row does not merely hide a picture, it collapses
// `Message`'s 32px flex gutter and slides the whole bubble sideways, which is
// only observable as a rect. The run is also not a DOM subtree — it spans
// sibling `MessageScrollerItem`s, because Content's MutationObserver watches
// `childList` with no `subtree` and a per-run wrapper would kill
// scroll-new-turn-to-top — so "these rows are one group" is a claim about
// attributes and geometry, not about nesting.
//
// The fixture, in order:
//   • a run of THREE consecutive user messages, then one assistant reply;
//   • a lone user message with a reply (a run of one);
//   • a pair of user messages split by a DAY boundary, which must break the run
//     even though no assistant spoke between them.
