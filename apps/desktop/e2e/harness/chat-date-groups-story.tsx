// Standalone browser story for the REAL transcript's day grouping — the
// centred date separators and the floating sticky date chip
// (`packages/blocks/src/desktop/agent-elements/{date-groups,date-separator,
// floating-date-header}.*`), mounted through the desktop's own `AgentChat`
// exactly as ChatPage does.
//
// Why a real browser rather than a render test: every claim worth making here
// is a LAYOUT claim. The chip is absolutely positioned in the same 36px lane
// the pinned-user-message bar was pushed out of (`sticky top-9`), and "they do
// not overlap" is a question about two rects, not about markup. Which day the
// chip names is driven by `useMessageScrollerVisibility`, which only produces a
// `currentAnchorId` once elements have been measured and observed. And the
// regression this feature could most easily reintroduce — the React #185
// "Maximum update depth" loop that a scroll-driven IN-FLOW element caused — is
// only observable by scrolling a live document and watching the console.
//
// Two cases from one page, selected by query string:
//   (default)      pinned user message ON  — chip and pin bar share the top
//   ?pin=off       the Appearance toggle is off — the chip must not move
//
// The fixture spans three days and is dated through `createdAt`, the same field
// ChatPage's `resolveCreatedAt` puts on every message. This is deliberately NOT
// a restamp of `chat-scroll-story.tsx`: that fixture carries no `createdAt` at
// all, which is exactly why chat-scroll-story.spec.ts and
// chat-message-align.spec.ts keep seeing a transcript with zero separators.
