// Standalone browser story for Detail level "None" — the rung of the Appearance
// → Chat ladder that shows no tool calls and no file edits at all, leaving a
// plain messaging view. The REAL `MessageList` renders the SAME fixture twice,
// once with `hideToolDetail` off and once with it on, so any difference between
// the two panes is attributable to that one pref.
//
// Why this needs a real browser and not a unit test: the interesting failure is
// not "a tool row is still visible", it is "a turn that renders nothing left an
// EMPTY row behind". Those rows are `MessageScrollerItem`s carrying
// `content-visibility:auto` with a 10rem intrinsic estimate — an empty one is
// invisible to the eye in a screenshot and invisible to a render-count
// assertion, but it still occupies a scroll slot and still puts a gap in the
// transcript. Counting the items the scroller actually emitted, and checking
// that none of them is empty, is the assertion that catches it.
//
// The fixture covers the four turn shapes that decide the behaviour:
//   0. assistant-only, pure tool calls (no user message) — must vanish at None
//   1. user + assistant prose + a tool call    — prose stays, tool row goes
//   2. user + assistant with ONLY tool calls   — user prompt stays, no reply row
//   3. user + a FAILED tool call               — the failure must survive
//   4. user + an INTERRUPTED tool-only reply   — turn status must survive
//
// HARNESS LIMIT: this asserts what the transcript emits. It says nothing about
// the settings UI that writes the pref (see tool-detail-ladder.test.ts for the
// ladder arithmetic).
