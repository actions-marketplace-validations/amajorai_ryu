// Real-browser spec for the card's MILLED EDGE, mounted through the employee
// badge story (`e2e/harness/employee-badge-story.{html,tsx}`) — the desktop's
// own instance of the shared `PassCardShell`.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS. The card's thickness is a stack of slices along Z, and each
// slice is tinted for its OWN depth: shoulders in shadow, a bright core. That
// per-slice tint is the only thing shading the edge ACROSS its thickness — the
// brushed ramp underneath runs along the card's LENGTH and is identical on every
// slice. Lose the tint and the thickness becomes one flat repeated column, the
// two face rings become the only depth cue, and the card reads as TWO cards
// stacked and joined at the waist. That exact report has now been filed twice:
// once against a symmetric ramp, and once after a merge kept the ramp and the
// slice geometry from the fix but dropped the tint.
//
// `packages/ui/src/components/pass-edge.test.ts` guards the arithmetic. This
// guards that the arithmetic reaches the DOM — a `bun test` cannot see a slice
// whose fill was overwritten at the call site, which is precisely how the
// regression landed the second time.
