//! Core Sandbox trait: ephemeral exec and long-lived workspace abstraction.
//!
//! Backend implementations live in sub-modules:
//! - [`wasmtime`] — wasmtime/WASI in-process ephemeral exec (M6 default)
//! - [`docker`] — Docker/OCI containers via the `docker` CLI (detect-only)
//! - [`microsandbox`] — microVMs via the `msb` CLI (detect-only)
//! - [`opensandbox`] — gVisor/Kata/Firecracker via the `osb` CLI (detect-only)
//! - [`daytona`] — remote sandboxes via the Daytona REST API (token-gated)
//!
//! Sandboxing is "what runs" (an execution context), so this lives in Core per
//! the Core-vs-Gateway rule (CLAUDE.md §1). Policy over *what is allowed* inside
//! a sandbox (DLP, network egress, budget) remains in Gateway; Core only decides
//! which backend to spawn and what spec to hand it.
//!
//! Two shapes are expressed by the trait:
//! - **Ephemeral exec** — one command, capture stdout/stderr, auto-teardown.
//! - **Long-lived workspace** — create a persistent context, exec multiple
//!   commands inside it, then destroy it.
//!
//! Both shapes carry a [`SandboxCapabilities`] descriptor that defaults to
//! deny-all (no FS paths, no network). The backend must enforce these; Core
//! does not re-check them after construction.
//!
//! Backends register through [`SandboxBackend`] and are selected by name via
//! [`select_backend`]. The only hard rule: `select_backend` never returns an
//! unknown backend silently — it errors out so callers can surface the problem.
