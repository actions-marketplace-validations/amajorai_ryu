//! **Output styles** — Ryu's port of Claude Code output styles (`docs/output-styles.md`).
//!
//! An output style changes *how* an agent answers — role, tone, default response
//! shape — by editing the system prompt for the turn. It never changes what the
//! agent knows, which tools it has, or which model runs. The body is prose, never
//! code: nothing in this crate (or downstream of it) evaluates it, which is why a
//! style needs zero capability grants — the same argument `ThemeContribution`
//! makes for themes.
//!
//! This module owns:
//! - the file format ([`parse_output_style_md`]) — YAML frontmatter + Markdown body,
//!   byte-compatible with a Claude Code output style;
//! - the four-source merge ([`OutputStyleRegistry`]) — plugin contributions, the
//!   user root, project roots, managed settings, later sources winning;
//! - the node-default selection ([`load_selection`] / [`set_selection`]);
//! - the text actually injected into the system prompt ([`style_block`]).
//!
//! **What it deliberately does NOT own.** `keep-coding-instructions` is surfaced
//! faithfully on the record and interpreted nowhere in here: per design §2 it
//! decides whether the style body *replaces* or is *appended after* the agent's
//! base instructions, and that assembly happens at the injection seams in
//! `apps/core/src/sidecar/adapters/mod.rs`. [`style_block`] returns body + adherence
//! reminder; the caller owns the merge. Likewise the three-tier selection
//! (per-turn → per-conversation → node default) resolves in Core, which holds the
//! request and the conversation row; this crate supplies only the node-default tier
//! and the [`OutputStyleRegistry::forced_style`] override that beats all three.
//!
//! Core-vs-crate rule: like `ryu-skills`, this crate has **ZERO dependency on
//! `apps/core`**. The Ryu data folder is inverted in via [`set_data_dir`], and the
//! live registry is published to a process-global handle via [`set_global_registry`]
//! so the HTTP handlers in [`api`] reach it without a `State` extractor.
