//! BlueBubbles channel adapter — iMessage, bridged through a Mac.
//!
//! Apple ships no iMessage API. The only way to send and receive iMessage
//! programmatically is to drive a signed-in Mac, and [BlueBubbles
//! Server](https://bluebubbles.app) is the community bridge that does exactly
//! that: the operator installs it on a Mac that is logged into their Apple ID, and
//! it exposes a small REST API over the LAN plus an outbound webhook for new
//! messages. Ryu talks to that REST API.
//!
//! ## Why this is an adapter and not a sidecar
//!
//! The Mac-side process already exists and is not ours — BlueBubbles Server is the
//! sidecar, it is just one the operator runs. From the gateway's point of view what
//! remains is an HTTP client plus a webhook receiver, which is precisely the shape
//! of every other adapter in this crate. There is no channel-sidecar mechanism in
//! this repo and inventing one here would buy nothing: this file is a transport and
//! a handful of platform verbs, and [`handle_turn`] does everything in between.
//!
//! ## What the operator has to set up
//!
//! 1. BlueBubbles Server installed and running on a Mac signed into iMessage, with
//!    a server password set.
//! 2. `server_url` pointing at that Mac (`http://192.168.1.10:1234`) and `password`
//!    matching its server password.
//! 3. A webhook in BlueBubbles' settings pointing at THIS gateway's
//!    `webhook_bind` + `webhook_path` — with the shared-secret token appended (see
//!    below). The exact URL to paste is logged at INFO when the receiver binds.
//! 4. Optionally the **Private API** helper (a bundled dylib the operator installs
//!    into Messages). Without it iMessage can only send text and attachments;
//!    typing indicators, read receipts and tapback reactions all require it, which
//!    is why [`ChannelCaps`] for this adapter is computed from
//!    [`BlueBubblesChannelConfig::private_api`] rather than being a constant.
//!
//! ## Webhook security, honestly
//!
//! BlueBubbles does **not** sign its webhooks — there is no HMAC header to verify
//! the way WhatsApp's `X-Hub-Signature-256` lets [`crate::whatsapp`] fail closed.
//! Anything that can reach the receiver can therefore claim to be an inbound
//! iMessage. Two things stand between that and an open relay:
//!
//! - **A shared-secret token.** The receiver derives a high-entropy token from the
//!   server password (see [`derive_webhook_secret`]) and refuses any POST that does
//!   not present it, as a trailing path segment, a `?token=` query parameter, or an
//!   `x-ryu-webhook-token` header. It is compared in constant time. The token is
//!   *derived*, not random, so it survives a gateway restart without the operator
//!   re-pasting the URL.
//! - **The access gate.** Even a forged payload still has to get past
//!   [`crate::pairing`], so a spoofed sender is answered with a pairing code, not an
//!   agent turn.
//!
//! Residual risk, stated plainly: the token travels in a URL over plain HTTP on the
//! LAN (BlueBubbles has no HTTPS of its own), so anyone who can observe that traffic
//! can replay it, and there is no nonce or timestamp to make a replay stale. Bind
//! `webhook_bind` to loopback or a private interface — the adapter warns loudly at
//! startup if it is asked to listen on a routable address — and front it with a
//! reverse proxy if it must leave the LAN.
