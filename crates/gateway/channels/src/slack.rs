//! Slack channel adapter (Socket Mode).
//!
//! Registers a Slack app via its app-level token and opens a Socket Mode
//! WebSocket through `apps.connections.open` — no public webhook URL required,
//! mirroring the Telegram adapter's long-poll design.
//!
//! The adapter owns exactly two things (see [`crate`]): the **transport** — this
//! socket, its ack envelopes and its reconnect budget — and Slack's **verbs**:
//! `chat.postMessage`, `reactions.add`, the external-upload flow, and the
//! assistant thread status that stands in for a typing indicator. Everything
//! between them (the access gate, media ingest, the Core call, reply delivery)
//! is [`handle_turn`]'s job, so this file no longer re-derives any of it.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! Slack is a threaded platform, and a busy channel is only readable if the bot
//! answers *in* the thread of the message that triggered it. Two ids are needed
//! for that (the channel and the `thread_ts`) but [`InboundMessage::chat_id`]
//! carries one. The kernel's [`pack_thread`] / [`unpack_thread`] convention is
//! what resolves it, and this adapter uses it twice:
//!
//! - `chat_id` stays the **bare channel id**. It is what the group allowlist is
//!   configured with, so packing a thread into it would silently stop matching.
//! - `message_id` carries the triggering `ts` and — only when the message was
//!   already inside a thread — its parent anchor, packed the same way. A Slack
//!   timestamp is `<seconds>.<micros>`, digits and a dot, so the `:` separator is
//!   unambiguous and a bare ts round-trips to `(ts, None)`.
//!
//! That keeps the adapter stateless: [`Channel::open_thread`] needs the parent
//! anchor and [`Channel::react`] needs the triggering ts, and both read the value
//! they need out of the same field rather than out of a side map that would leak
//! an entry every time the access gate refused a message.
//!
//! # mrkdwn
//!
//! Slack does not render CommonMark. Its "mrkdwn" flavour uses `*bold*`,
//! `_italic_`, `~strike~` and `<url|label>`, and has no headings and no tables —
//! so a reply posted raw shows literal asterisks where the agent meant emphasis.
//! [`to_mrkdwn`] does that translation for [`Channel::send_rich`]; it is a small
//! single-pass converter rather than a Markdown parser, because the alternative
//! (a full parser dependency) buys nothing for a surface with this few marks.
