//! WhatsApp Business channel adapter (Meta Cloud API).
//!
//! Unlike Telegram/Discord, the WhatsApp Cloud API has no polling endpoint:
//! inbound messages arrive as webhook callbacks. This adapter's
//! [`run`](Channel::run) loop therefore binds a small HTTP receiver that handles
//! Meta's two webhook flows:
//!
//! - `GET`  the subscription verification handshake (`hub.challenge`).
//! - `POST` inbound message deliveries, which are parsed, have their media
//!   ingested, and are then handed to the shared [`handle_turn`] path.
//!
//! Replies go back out via the Graph API `POST /{version}/{phone_number_id}/messages`.
//! In production, front [`WhatsAppChannelConfig::webhook_bind`] with a public
//! HTTPS reverse proxy — Meta requires HTTPS for webhook delivery.
//!
//! ## Everything is one endpoint
//!
//! The Cloud API is unusually narrow: text, reactions, read receipts and the
//! typing indicator are all the *same* `POST .../messages` call with a different
//! body. That is why the payload builders below are pure functions — they are the
//! only thing that distinguishes those verbs, so they are also the only thing
//! worth unit-testing.
//!
//! ## The typing indicator needs an inbound message id
//!
//! `{status:"read", message_id, typing_indicator:{type:"text"}}` marks the
//! inbound message read *and* shows "typing…". It cannot be addressed to a chat —
//! only to a specific inbound message id — and Meta dismisses it as soon as the
//! bot replies, expiring it after ~25s otherwise. The kernel's [`crate::keep_typing`]
//! keepalive hands us only a chat id, so this adapter keeps a small map of the
//! latest inbound wamid per conversation and looks the id up there. With no id
//! known there is simply nothing to show, so [`Channel::send_typing`] no-ops.
//!
//! ## Commands are discovered here, not executed here
//!
//! Plugin/skill/agent commands already *work* on WhatsApp: Core's `pre_user_turn`
//! hooks intercept them inside `run_reply_text`, so the text only has to reach
//! Core intact — which it does. What WhatsApp lacks is any way to *discover* them,
//! because the platform has no command menu to publish to. So `/help` (and
//! `/commands`) is answered locally from the menu Core serves, and every other
//! command is routed to the agent untouched.
//!
//! ## Voice replies are declined, not faked
//!
//! Core's TTS emits WAV and the Cloud API's audio type accepts ogg/opus, mpeg,
//! mp4, amr and aac — not WAV. [`media::wav_delivery`] therefore reports
//! `Unsupported` for this platform and [`handle_turn`] never asks for speech;
//! [`Channel::send_voice`] fails loudly rather than uploading a file the
//! recipient's phone cannot play.
