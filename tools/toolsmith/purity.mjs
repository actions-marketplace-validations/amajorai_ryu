// Static determinism scan for a Ryu sandboxed tool body.
//
// The runtime half of this lives in `harness.mjs`, which shadows every ambient
// nondeterministic global so reaching for one throws. That is the stronger check —
// but it only fires on a code path a case actually exercises. This scan is the
// cheap complement: it reads the source and rejects the reference outright, so a
// `Math.random()` sitting in an untested branch is caught before it ever ships.
//
// Deliberately a regex scan and not an AST walk. The body is a FRAGMENT with a
// top-level `return`, which no standard JS parser accepts as a Program — parsing
// would mean wrapping it first, and a wrapper changes the offsets every diagnostic
// points at. The patterns below are anchored on word boundaries and stripped of
// comments and strings first, which is accurate enough for a denylist whose whole
// purpose is to be conservative.
