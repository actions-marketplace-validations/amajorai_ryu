## How the pieces connect

The same contracts connect the runtime, integration seams, surfaces, and deployment choices.

Build with SDKs, Core, Gateway, apps, plugins, and APIs. Run Ryu locally, on your own server, or in
Ryu Cloud through Desktop, Web, browser, mobile, CLI, bots, and channels.

This repository contains Core, Gateway, CLI, Desktop, Island, shared runtime packages, and
self-hosting files. SDKs and examples live in the [public SDK hub](https://github.com/amajorai/ryu-sdk);
app source lives in its `ryu-<app>` satellite; plugin source and the catalog live in the
[Marketplace repository](https://github.com/amajorai/ryu-marketplace). The full product
documentation is at [docs.ryuhq.com](https://docs.ryuhq.com).

## How Ryu compares

These tables compare documented product surfaces, not model quality, latency, or security
certification.

Legend: ✅ first-class documented capability · 🟡 available through composition, configuration, or
a limited/preview surface · ❌ not the product's primary documented surface.

## Quick Start

Run Core and Gateway on infrastructure you control. No Ryu account or control-plane service is
required.

**macOS and Linux**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amajorai/ryu/main/install.sh | sh
ryu-cli
```

**Windows PowerShell**:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amajorai/ryu/main/install.ps1 | iex
ryu-cli
```

The installer starts Core and Gateway with bundled local defaults. See the
[self-hosting guide](https://docs.ryuhq.com/docs/start-here/getting-started/self-host)
for providers, deployment, and configuration.

## Licensing

[`LICENSING.md`](./LICENSING.md) and [`TRADEMARK.md`](./TRADEMARK.md) for the full boundary.
