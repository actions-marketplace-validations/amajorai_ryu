// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/safe-url.ts
//
// The render-layer guards for publisher-supplied strings that reach the DOM,
// shared by every catalog surface.
//
// Catalog sources are untrusted — a community listing's `homepage`, a release's
// `url`, a manifest's `privacyPolicyUrl` are all publisher-controlled strings.
// Core allowlists schemes on the way out, and this is the second half of that
// defence: nothing reaches an `<a href>` without parsing as http(s) here, so a
// `javascript:` or `data:` URL cannot execute even if a backend sanitizer is ever
// bypassed or a new source forgets to call one.
//
// {@link safeCssBackground} is the same posture one layer over: a manifest's
// `banner.background` / `banner.colors` land in a CSS background, which is a
// different sink with a different worst case.

 *  escape into a new rule the way it could in a raw `style="…"` string — the
 *  browser just drops an unparseable declaration. What a value CAN still do is
 *  reference a remote asset, and that is the real leak: a `url(https://…)` in a
 *  listing's banner turns every viewer of that detail page into a beacon hit
 *  carrying their IP, without the page ever showing anything unusual. A character
 *  allowlist would additionally reject the legitimate forms authors do use —
 *  `oklch(…)`, `color-mix(…)`, `var(--…)`, multi-stop gradients — so it would be
 *  both stricter and less safe to maintain than naming the sinks.
 *
 *  The whole value is DROPPED rather than scrubbed: a background with one function
 *  removed is a different background, and silently painting something the author
 *  did not write is worse than falling back to the derived wash. */
