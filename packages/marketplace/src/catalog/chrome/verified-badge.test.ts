// Label rules for the publisher verification badge.
//
// The badge's label is the ONLY thing that distinguishes this axis — is the
// PUBLISHING ORGANIZATION identity-verified, the `org_verified` field — from the
// other two "verified" chips this repo already renders (the web marketplace's
// manifest SIGNATURE chip, which owns the bare wire word `verified` and means
// install trust, and the reviews panel's "Verified purchase"), and from the
// amber "Not reviewed by Ryu" notice it can legitimately sit beside. If it ever
// degrades to a bare "Verified" or — worse — to a bare "Community", the badge is
// still on screen and still looks right, so nothing but these assertions catches
// it. That is why the label lives in an exported pure function rather than
// inline in the JSX: the failure mode is silent otherwise.
