// Validation for the untrusted `icon_dither` spec a catalog entry carries, shared
// by every surface that paints one (the list card's icon square, the detail hero,
// the hero's own icon tile).
//
// It lives in its own module rather than on the card because the validator is the
// safety boundary, not a rendering detail: `fillOf` THROWS on an unknown palette
// name, so a typo'd colour in one manifest would take down the whole catalog list
// with a render error. Exactly one implementation means a new painting surface
// cannot accidentally ship without the guard.
