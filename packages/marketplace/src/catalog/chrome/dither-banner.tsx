// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/chrome/dither-banner.tsx
//
// The listing hero's background wash. Extracted out of `apps-catalog-section.tsx`
// so every realm's detail hero paints the same thing — the Apps/Plugins hero was
// the only one that had it, which is why an app opened with real art and an MCP
// server or an engine opened with a flat grey slab.
//
// Three tiers, in order:
//
//  1. **The listing's own `icon_dither`** — the generative wash its CARD already
//     shows. Using it here is why hero and card never disagree.
//  2. **An explicit `banner`** — a flat `background`, a raster `imageUrl`,
//     author-declared `colors`, `style: "animated-gradient"` with its shader
//     field, or `style: "dither"` with a grain overlay. Outranks tier 1: it is
//     the author saying "the hero is not just my icon, bigger".
//  3. **A flat fallback** — `icon_background`/`accent_color`, else the muted
//     surface.
//
// Tier 1 is the reason the store stopped looking generic: with no `banner` (which
// no first-party manifest has ever declared) every hero painted the SAME hardcoded
// indigo `linear-gradient`, so all 62 detail pages opened with an identical purple
// slab that had nothing to do with the app.
//
// WITHIN tier 2 the order is animated-gradient → background → imageUrl → colors,
// and the picture is painted OVER whatever paints beneath it rather than instead
// of it, so a transparent PNG letterboxes onto the author's colour instead of onto
// grey. `style` does not select between the CSS keys: it is a label ("flat",
// "image") that describes what the author declared, and honouring it as a switch
// would mean an item with `style: "flat"` and only an `imageUrl` paints nothing at
// all. `animated-gradient` is the ONE exception and is documented as such on the
// type — a WebGL renderer is not something a surface should acquire because a key
// happened to be present.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHERE THE ANIMATED GRADIENT IS ALLOWED TO BE LIVE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// It renders through WebGL, and browsers cap simultaneous contexts (~16), evicting
// the OLDEST to satisfy a new request. So instances do not merely cost — past a
// point they KILL each other, and this app already has that crash on file (Sentry
// RUST-2A, "WebGL context is lost" via `transferToImageBitmap`). A 60-card grid
// each running a field would exhaust the cap on first paint.
//
// The rule, enforced by the `live` prop rather than by documentation:
//
//  * **LIVE — the detail hero, and nothing else.** `ListingHero` is the one caller
//    that passes `live`, and it passes it unconditionally from the inside, so no
//    call site can forget or over-claim it. A dozen desktop sections mount that
//    hero, but every one of them mounts it inside a `*Detail*` pane — one band at
//    the top of one pane — so the real ceiling is one context per SIMULTANEOUSLY
//    OPEN detail pane, which split view can multiply but only up to the number of
//    panes (≤4 in a 4-way split). Sections with two or three `ListingHero` calls
//    (`EnginesCatalogSection`, `ToolsLibrary`, `InstalledSection`) are alternate
//    BRANCHES of one detail component, not a list, so they mount one at a time.
//    Every live context is therefore the thing the viewer is looking at. Putting a
//    hero inside a repeated row would break that arithmetic — the invariant to
//    preserve is "one per pane", not "one per component".
//  * **STATIC — everywhere else, by construction.** `live` defaults to false, so
//    cards, grids, list rows and any future caller get a painted div with no
//    canvas, no context and no rAF, without having to know any of this. Today the
//    card path does not read `banner` at all — `entry.banner` is handed only to
//    `ListingHero` — so the grid is safe by absence as well as by default; the
//    default is what keeps it safe the day a card does start painting one. The
//    static paint is a CSS approximation derived from the SAME preset table the
//    shader reads (`animatedGradientCss`), so a card and its hero are recognisably
//    the same listing.
//
// The static paint is also the FLOOR, not just the alternative: it is painted on
// the wrapper underneath the canvas, so an evicted context, a refused one, or a
// shader chunk that fails to load leaves it standing instead of a black hole.
// `prefers-reduced-motion` drops to it too — subscribed, not sampled, so flipping
// the OS setting unmounts the canvas mid-session. Upstream offers no reduced-motion
// guidance and the obvious reading (`speed: 0`) still holds a context and still
// composites; stopped means stopped.
//
// EVERY key here is publisher-supplied and reaches a DOM sink, so all of them are
// guarded here and not upstream: Core keeps `banner` as opaque JSON precisely so a
// new key needs no Core release, which also means Core never validates one. The
// colours reach a CSS background AND a shader uniform, so they go through the same
// `safeCssBackground` the other keys use; the numbers reach GPU uniforms, where an
// unbounded `swirlIterations` is a frozen tab rather than an ugly banner, so
// `resolveAnimatedGradient` clamps every one of them.
