// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/icon-url.ts
//
// Catalog icons come from two manifest fields: `icon` (an Icon-primitive id like
// `lucide:brain` or a bare Hugeicons name) and `icon_url` (a raster logo). A
// publisher naturally reaches for the `icon` field and pastes an image URL there
// too — so we accept a URL in EITHER field, but only when it is served from the
// GitHub image CDN. That keeps the surface useful (GitHub is where plugin repos
// already host their art) without turning an icon field into an arbitrary remote
// fetch that could phone home or track an install via the image load.
//
// A third shape, `svgl:<slug>`, names a brand mark on svgl.app's public CDN (see
// `@ryu/ui/components/svgl.ts`). It is a fixed, keyless asset host — the same
// posture as the Iconify host the Icon primitive already fetches from — so a
// branded listing (Brave, Firecrawl, Notion, …) can carry its real logo without
// every publisher pasting a raw URL.

 *  See {@link resolveSvglIcon}; the caller passes the loaded svgl index so a brand
 *  with a dark-theme variant gets one.
 *
 *  `icon_url` is the dedicated raster slot — publisher-declared logo art, already
 *  rendered for any `https:` host (the app CSP permits `img-src https:`), so it is
 *  passed through unchanged; that keeps first-party integration logos (Composio,
 *  integrations.sh CDNs) working. The GitHub-image allowlist applies ONLY to a URL
