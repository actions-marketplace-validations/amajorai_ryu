// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/detail/channel-picker.tsx
//
// The release-train selector shown beside a listing's install control.
//
// A listing can publish more than one train — `stable` plus any of `beta`, `rc`,
// `nightly`, `canary`, whatever its published versions spell — and the train is
// read off the version itself (`1.4.0-beta.2` IS the beta channel), never
// declared. This component only PRESENTS what the host resolved; it invents
// nothing, which is why a listing with a single train renders no control at all
// rather than a dropdown with one entry.
//
// Two rules it exists to make visible:
//
//   - a channel selects only its OWN builds, so a prerelease train can sit BEHIND
//     stable (a beta cut before the last patch is genuinely older), and
//   - a train that is browse-only — derived from a repository's git tags rather
//     than served by the marketplace — can never be installed, so it is shown as
//     context and never as a choice.
