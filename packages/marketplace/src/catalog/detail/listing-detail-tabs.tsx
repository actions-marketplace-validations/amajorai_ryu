// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/detail/listing-detail-tabs.tsx
//
// The tabbed body of a listing's detail view — README, API, Versions,
// Dependencies, Reviews, Health.
//
// Extracted so the STORE and the INSTALLED list render the same thing. They used
// to diverge badly: browsing a listing gave you the full tab set, and then
// selecting that very same app under Store → Installed dropped you into a
// separate renderer with no README, no version history, no health grade and no
// reviews. Installing an app made its documentation disappear, which is exactly
// backwards.
//
// `overview` is optional because the two hosts differ in one honest way: the store
// panel leads with an Overview tab (description, permissions, bundled runnables),
// while the installed view already renders its own header with the lifecycle
// controls — enable/disable, uninstall, launch, grants — and wants these tabs
// BELOW it, not wrapped around a duplicate summary. Passing the node in keeps one
// tab implementation rather than two that drift.
