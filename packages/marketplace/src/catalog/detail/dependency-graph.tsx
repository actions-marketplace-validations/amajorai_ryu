// The "what else comes with this" half of the Dependencies tab: the manifest's
// `requires.apps` resolved into the tree Core actually walks.
//
// A manifest names ids and nothing else ("@ryu/spaces", ">=1.2.0"), which is what
// this tab used to render — a flat list of raw ids. That hid the two facts a
// reader needs before clicking Install: how deep the chain goes (Core installs the
// whole closure, `install_plugin_from_catalog` phase 1), and which of those are
// already here versus arriving alongside (Core auto-enables them topologically,
// `lifecycle::enable_app`). Neither is a new resolver — this is the same graph,
// shown before the click instead of after it.
//
// Live install/enable state crosses the HOST seam: a desktop store knows what its
// active node has, the read-only web catalog knows nothing about any node. Absent
// a lookup this degrades to the flat list it always rendered rather than asserting
// "installs with this" on a surface with no way to check.
