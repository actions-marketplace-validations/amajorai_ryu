// Plain-English names + one-line descriptions for the permission grants an app
// (plugin) requests, so a non-technical user understands what they are approving
// or revoking instead of reading raw identifiers like `hook:run-agent`. Shared by
// the enable consent dialog (store) AND the per-app permissions / revocation view,
// so the vocabulary is consistent everywhere. Mirrors Core's grant strings
// (`bridge.rs` / manifest `permission_grants`); unknown grants humanize gracefully.
