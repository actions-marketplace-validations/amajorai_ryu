// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/compatibility.test.ts
//
// The client-side half of the host-floor gate.
//
// Core is the authority that actually refuses an install, but it can only observe
// its own version and the Gateway's. Every other surface — desktop, island,
// mobile, extension, web, a separately-installed CLI — is reported as an advisory
// `unknown`. `evaluateCompatibility` is what lets a client that DOES know its own
// version turn that advisory into a real refusal, which is the entire reason a
// per-surface floor is worth declaring.
//
// The property under test throughout: this pass only ever REFINES. It must never
// mark something compatible that Core called incompatible, and it must never
// invent a refusal from a floor it cannot parse.
