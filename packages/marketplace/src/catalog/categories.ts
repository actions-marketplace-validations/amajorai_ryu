//
// The Store's category vocabulary — the shelves the Apps and Plugins tabs group
// their cards into, and the order those shelves appear in.
//
// Order is EDITORIAL, not alphabetical. A store front page is a ranking: the
// shelves people came for go first, the plumbing goes last. Alphabetising it would
// open every visit with "Automation" and bury "Search" in the middle.
//
// The vocabulary is deliberately SHARED with the manifests: a manifest's free-text
// `category` is matched against this list (case- and separator-insensitively), so
// "Developer Tools", "developer-tools" and "developer tools" all land on the same
// shelf. That tolerance is the point — the value crosses a JSON boundary written by
// hand, and a shelf that silently splits in two because someone typed a hyphen is a
// worse failure than a slightly fuzzy match.
//
// An UNKNOWN category is not an error and is never dropped: it renders as its own
// shelf, sorted after every known one. So a satellite app can introduce a category
// the shipped client has never heard of and it still lists correctly — the same
// degrade-don't-break rule `stability` and `surfaces` already follow.
