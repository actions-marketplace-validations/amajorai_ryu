// packages/marketplace/src/catalog/surface-labels.ts
//
// Human labels for the host surfaces a listing declares support for.
//
// Shared because BOTH the card (chrome/store-catalog-card.tsx) and the detail
// meta strip (detail/detail-panels.tsx) render them, and a listing that says
// "Desktop" in one place and "desktop" in the other reads as a bug. It lives
// beside grant-labels.ts / plugin-id.ts / safe-url.ts, the other small shared
// presentation helpers.

 *
 *  Pinned to {@link Surface} with `satisfies`, which is the whole point: this map
 *  had silently drifted from the contract, defining `browser` and `tui` — neither
 *  of which is a real surface, so neither could ever be rendered — while omitting
 *  `gateway`, `core`, and the actual `extension`. A manifest targeting the browser
 *  extension therefore displayed the raw token. The satisfies clause turns that
 *  class of drift into a build error. */

 *  `engines.ryu`, and to a user on a desktop install the thing that is too old is
 *  the app itself, not a node they have never heard of. Every other surface uses
 *  its normal label.

 *  Returns `null` — not an empty string — when only advisory `unknown` entries are
