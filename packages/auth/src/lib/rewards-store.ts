/**
 * Rewards store catalog — the single source of truth for what a user can buy
 * with points, and how much each item costs.
 *
 * THIS IS THE THING THE POINTS ECONOMY EXISTS FOR. The points earned by usage,
 * streaks, milestones and quests are spendable currency; this catalog is the
 * store they're spent in. It deliberately SUPERSEDES the feature-unlock sink
 * (`features.ts`'s progressive tier): instead of spending points to switch on
 * cosmetic settings, points now buy real value — provider credits, desktop
 * access, plan time, nodes. The feature-unlock rows are not deleted here (they
 * stay for users who already spent there), but every NEW earning surface
 * advertises this store as where points go.
 *
 * SAME DISCIPLINE AS `plans.ts` / `features.ts`: ONE const, imported
 * everywhere. `key` is stable and persisted in `PointsRedemption` rows; never
 * rename in flight.
 *
 * ITEM KINDS AND THEIR FULFILMENT. The router that serves this catalog decides
 * how each kind materializes, and the kinds are the contract it switches on:
 *  - `credit` — a pool-restricted `CreditGrant` into the wallet of an org the
 *    user chooses at redemption time (the same reward-received dialog quests
 *    use). Fulfilled automatically.
 *  - `desktop_access` / `plan_time` / `node_time` — entitlement grants that
 *    need an existing entitlement/billing path to land in. The redemption row is
 *    created `pending`; fulfilment is whoever owns the entitlement side. These
 *    exist now so the catalog is real, and the router refuses them loudly until
 *    a fulfilment path is wired rather than silently doing nothing.
