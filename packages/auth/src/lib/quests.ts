/**
 * Quest catalog — the single source of truth for what quests exist, what cadence
 * they run on, how completion is detected, and what each one pays.
 *
 * SAME DISCIPLINE AS `plans.ts` / `features.ts`: ONE `QUESTS` const, imported
 * everywhere, so the catalog can never drift from the code that renders or pays
 * it. A quest's `key` is stable — it is persisted in `UserQuest` rows and in
 * the `PointsLedger` / grant `refId` idempotency keys. Never rename one in
 * flight; re-keying orphan every row that already recorded it.
 *
 * CADENCE IS WHAT A QUEST RESETS ON. `daily`, `weekly`, and `monthly` reset on
 * their calendar boundary via a `periodKey` ("2026-08-17" / "2026-W33" /
 * "2026-08") — the same "YYYY-MM" discipline the referral campaign instances
 * use, generalized to shorter windows. `one_time` never resets (claim once,
 * forever). `permanent` is a non-resetting REPEATABLE quest: the user can claim
 * it again whenever the target is met again (a "refer one more friend" style
 * treadmill), and the claim's `refId` carries a nonce so each claim is its own
 * idempotent row.
 *
 * VERIFICATION IS HOW COMPLETION IS KNOWN, AND IT IS THE FRAUD SURFACE.
 *  - `auto` — the server derives progress from data it already trusts (referral
 *    rows, a ledger). Nobody can claim one without the underlying signal.
 *  - `submit` — the user submits proof (a link, a handle) that a HUMAN reviews
 *    before the reward is claimable. This is the `UpdatesRedemption` model: the
 *    post must be real, public, and on-mission before it pays. A submit quest
 *    has NO reward until its proof is approved — the reward field below is the
 *    same shape, but the router refuses to pay it while the proof is pending.
 *
 * Nothing here writes. Like `points.ts`, this module is pure and server-side:
 * the API layer owns the DB writes and the idempotency keys.
