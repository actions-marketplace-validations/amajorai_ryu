 * The friendly-mode half of the copy above, and the rule it is written to.

 * "Vector" and "Graph" are the names of the algorithms, not of the outcomes. A

 * retrieval architecture; they are choosing between "fast" and "joins facts up".
 * So friendly mode renames the OPTIONS — Quick search / Connected search — while
 * the wire values (`vector` / `graph`) and the technical labels are untouched, and
 * turning the toggle off puts the algorithm names straight back.
 *
 * The friendly blurbs are NOT shorter summaries. Friendly mode ships default-ON
 * (`DEFAULT_FRIENDLY_MODE`), which means this is the copy nearly every user reads,
 * so every consequence the technical blurb carries has to survive the rewrite:
 * Graph's cross-document reach, that preparing it takes longer, and that an
 * uploaded file whose text was never extracted is indexed by name and type alone.
 * Dropping one of those to sound friendlier would trade a hard word for a wrong
 * expectation, which is the opposite of the point. `spaces.test.ts` asserts each
 * of those three claims against the friendly blurb as well as the technical one.
 *
 * {@link RETRIEVAL_MODE_SCOPE} deliberately has NO friendly variant: it is already
 * plain language, it is the sentence this file has twice shipped wrong, and it is
 * pinned by name in three test suites. One sentence that both modes render is one
 * sentence that cannot drift into two different promises.

/**
 * WHERE the retrieval mode applies — the half of the story this UI has now got
 * wrong in both directions, and the half a user needs before picking Graph.
 *
 * `retrieval_mode` is read in exactly one place in Core: `SpaceStore::search_ext`
 * calls `space_mode()` and branches to `vector_search` or `graph_search`
 * (`crates/core/spaces/src/lib.rs`). What changed is how many paths reach that
 * function — two now do:
 *
 *  - `POST /api/spaces/:id/search` (`apps/core/src/server/mod.rs`), which a Spaces
 *    search box hits and which the `ryu_search_space` MCP tool calls when an agent
 *    is told to search a named space;
 *  - the automatic recall on a chat turn. `RetrievalStore::retrieve`
 *    (`crates/core/rag/src/lib.rs`) delegates the Spaces half of a recall back to
 *    `search_ext` via its `SpaceRecall` hook (implemented in
 *    `apps/core/src/rag_host.rs`), so an agent's allowlisted spaces are answered
 *    under their own mode.
 *
 * The history is worth keeping, because both failures were invisible from the UI:
 * the FIRST version of this copy claimed the setting decided "how this space finds
 * answers when an agent searches it" while chat recall never read the column
 * (overclaim); the correction then said chat "does not use this setting", which
 * became false the moment the delegate landed (underclaim). A control whose copy
 * understates it is not harmless — a user who wants graph recall in chat is told
 * to stop looking.
 *
 * So the sentence names WHERE it applies and does not enumerate what is excluded:
 * every path that searches a space now goes through the one branch point, and a
 * carve-out is exactly the kind of clause that rots when a new caller appears.
 *
 * Lives next to {@link RETRIEVAL_MODE_OPTIONS} and is rendered by
 * {@link RetrievalModeChoice} so both surfaces that offer the choice (the create
 * dialog and the Space detail card) state the same scope. Putting it in the
 * picker rather than in each caller is what stops one surface from drifting back
 * into a wider promise than the code keeps.

 *
 * Every document row used to carry a `<n> chunks` badge, files included. A file
 * whose text was never extracted gets exactly one chunk — `title` + mime, the
 * descriptor `SpaceStore::create_file` embeds — so a 300-page PDF sat in this list
 * reading "1 chunk", beside pages whose badge counts real extracted text, under a
 * heading with a search box. Nothing anywhere said the PDF's prose had never been
 * read. A user searching for a phrase they knew was in that PDF got no result and no
 * reason.
 *
 * That is why the badge REPLACES the count instead of sitting next to it. "1 chunk ·
 * Name only" invites the reading that one chunk of the file's *text* is indexed,
 * which is the same wrong belief in a smaller font.
 *
 * ## Why there are four sentences and not one
 *
 * Because there are four different things to do, and the reason a file is not
 * searchable is not observable from the file. Core distinguishes them on purpose:
 * `skipped` is *"nothing on this node can read this format — not an error, a missing
 * install"*; `failed` is *"something attempted the parse and could not finish it"*;
 * `unattempted` is *"nobody looked, as opposed to nobody could read it"*, which is
 * every file stored before extraction shipped. Collapsing those into "not
 * searchable" would leave a user with a fixable problem no way to learn it is
 * fixable — which is the same shape of defect as the badge itself.
 *
 * `skipped` is the only one that names an install, and it may do so **because it is
 * now true**: `create_file_indexed` really does route every upload through the
 * `document.parse` facade, so binding a provider changes the outcome of the next
 * upload. Naming a specific app is avoided anyway — which providers exist is the
 * Store's business and this sentence should not go stale when a fifth one ships.
 *
 * `indexed` has no entry: a searchable file is the unremarkable case and gets the
 * ordinary chunk badge, like a page. Its {@link SpaceDocumentRow.indexWarnings} are
 * still surfaced — a parse that half-worked and says nothing is the silent-drop bug
 * wearing a hat.
