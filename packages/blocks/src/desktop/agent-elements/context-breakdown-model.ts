 *
 * The eight hues are the validated categorical order (adjacent-pair CVD ΔE 9.1
 * light / 8.4 dark, normal-vision 19.6 / 19.3), stepped separately for the dark
 * surface rather than flipped. Three light-mode steps fall below 3:1 against
 * white, which obliges the relief rule — every band therefore also has a
 * labelled row below the bar, so identity is never carried by colour alone.
 *
 * Categories beyond the eight slots (persona, compaction summaries) render in
 * muted ink rather than a ninth invented hue; their rows still carry a text
 * label, which is what identifies them.
