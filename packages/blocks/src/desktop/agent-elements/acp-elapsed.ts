/**

/**
 * The elapsed time an ACP turn's footer should show, or null for "no duration".
 *
 * A turn is TERMINAL when Core sealed it (`done`) or when it is no longer the
 * live one (`isLive` false — the chat has gone back to ready, or this is an old
 * turn being read back). Terminal is deliberately not the same as "finalized":
 * a turn interrupted by Stop, an error, or a Core restart never receives its
 * `done:true` frame, and treating that as still-running is what made the meter
 * count up forever — and restart from zero on every reload.
 *
 * Terminal turns prefer Core's finalized `durationMs`, fall back to the last
 * value measured while the turn WAS live (`frozenMs`), and otherwise show
 * nothing rather than a fabricated one.
