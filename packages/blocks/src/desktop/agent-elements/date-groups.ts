// Day grouping for the chat transcript: which turns belong to the same calendar
// day in the DISPLAY time zone, and what the centred separator above each run
// should read.
//
// GRANULARITY IS THE TURN, NOT THE MESSAGE. A separator can only sit between
// direct children of the scroller's Content, and a turn is one child (see
// message-list.tsx). The visible consequence, which is the right trade: a reply
// that lands after midnight stays with the question that prompted it, under the
// question's date.
//
// CONSECUTIVE RUNS ONLY — never sort, never reorder. A merged transcript
// (useMergedAgentThreads stacks older threads above the live one) can be
// non-monotonic; grouping runs in place then shows the same date twice, which
// is honest, instead of scrambling the order history actually happened in.
//
// The day KEY is the epoch-ms of that day's midnight in the display zone,
// stringified. That makes it stable, comparable and directly renderable, and it
// comes straight from `startOfTodayMs` so a transcript can never disagree with
// the sidebar's buckets about where a day starts.
