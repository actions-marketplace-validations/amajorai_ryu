/**
 * Per-tool-call timing, the row-level counterpart to the whole-turn duration in
 * `message-stats.tsx`.
 *
 * # Two clocks, and why the authoritative one is Core's
 *
 * Core stamps every tool frame it emits with `startedAt` (opening frame) and
 * `startedAt`/`completedAt`/`durationMs` (closing frame), carried in the AI
 * SDK's `providerMetadata` under a `ryu` namespace and landing on the part as
 * `callProviderMetadata`. That stamp survives persistence, so a reopened
 * conversation shows the SAME duration the user watched live.
 *
 * The older mount-based clock is kept as a fallback for parts that carry no
 * stamp — an older Core, or any producer that has not been taught to stamp. Its
 * limitation is the reason the server stamp exists: a row's own mount can only
 * time a call this client actually watched run, so reopening a conversation
 * re-mounts finished rows. `isRunning` starting false is what stops that
 * fallback from displaying a running timer on a call that completed days ago —
 * at the cost of showing nothing at all for it. With a stamp, there is no such
 * cost.
 *
 * # The case this exists for
 *
 * A call that hung and a call that failed used to look identical: both just stop.
 * A stamped call that never received a closing frame renders its START CLOCK
 * rather than a duration ("started 14:32"), which is the one piece of
 * information that tells those two apart after the fact.
