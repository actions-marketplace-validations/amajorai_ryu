// The centred "Today" / "Yesterday" / "12 March 2026" row that opens each day in
// the transcript.
//
// It is a `Marker` (`@ryu/ui/components/marker`, `variant="separator"`), which is
// THE single inline-state row style in the transcript — day boundaries,
// interrupted turns, threshold failover and history notices all draw as one. The
// pill that used to live here moved to floating-date-header.tsx, its only
// remaining consumer: in flow the hairlines read better than a chip, and the
// chip's `bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-sm` only ever existed so the FLOATING
// copy stayed legible over live transcript text. The label itself cannot drift —
// both sites call `dayLabel()` from date-groups.ts.

/**
 * One day boundary in the transcript.
 *
 * MOUNTED AS A PLAIN, SCROLLER-INVISIBLE ELEMENT, NOT AN ITEM ROW — do not
 * "consistency-fix" this. Two separate reasons, both load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. A scroller item carries `[content-visibility:auto]` with
 *     `[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_10rem]`, i.e. a 160px placeholder reserved
 *     for a ~40px row. Every separator would open a gap it never fills.
 *  2. An item that looked like a turn could be picked as the scroll target when
 *     new content arrives, so a new day would scroll the SEPARATOR to the top
 *     instead of the user's new question. No `messageId` and no anchor keeps it
 *     invisible to the scroller's follow logic: it is a bare row that only
 *     carries the day's label, exactly like the old `MessageScrollerItem`-less
 *     separator before it.
 *
 * `Marker` satisfies both — it renders a bare `<div>` through `useRender` with no
 * wrapper of its own, and `data-slot` passed as a prop wins over the primitive's
 * own `state.slot` (`mergeObjects(stateProps, resolvedProps)`), so the e2e
 * selector below is preserved. `chat-date-groups-story.spec.ts:111-122` asserts
 * exactly this shape and must keep passing untouched.
 *
 * It must also stay a DIRECT child of the scroller's Content (the element with
 * `data-slot="message-scroller-content"`): the transcript's follow logic and the
 * date-groups spec both treat it as a plain sibling of the turn rows, never as
 * part of one. Interleave, never wrap.
