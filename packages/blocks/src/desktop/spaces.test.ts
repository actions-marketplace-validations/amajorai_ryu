//
// The Spaces retrieval copy, held to what Core actually does.
//
// This file exists because of one sentence, which has now been wrong twice in
// OPPOSITE directions — which is the whole argument for pinning copy.
//
//  1. The Retrieval card used to read "How this space finds answers when an agent
//     searches it" — a claim over the whole agent surface, made at the exact moment
//     the user chooses between Vector and Graph. At the time `retrieval_mode`
//     reached one endpoint (`POST /api/spaces/:id/search`, via
//     `SpaceStore::search_ext` → `space_mode`), while the automatic recall on a chat
//     turn went through `RetrievalStore::retrieve`, which was cosine-only and never
//     read the column. A user could set a space to Graph, be told that decides how
//     agents search it, and get cosine on every chat turn forever.
//  2. The correction said chat recall "does not use this setting". Core then gave
//     `RetrievalStore` a `SpaceRecall` delegate that answers an agent's allowlisted
//     spaces through `search_ext` — the function that reads the column — so the
//     carve-out became false and the copy started UNDERclaiming: a user who wanted
//     graph recall in chat was told to stop looking.
//
// The Rust half of the claim is pinned in `apps/desktop/src/lib/api/spaces.test.ts`
// (which can read Core's sources) and now anchors the whole chain, not one endpoint.
// Pinned HERE is the copy: that the scope sentence exists, names the surfaces, does
// not reinstate the carve-out, and is rendered by the PICKER rather than by one of
// its two call sites — a scope line living in a caller is a scope line the other
// caller can ship without.
//
// ── Why this reads the file instead of importing it ──────────────────────────
//
// `spaces.tsx` imports `@ryu/ui/components/*` without file extensions. That subpath
// resolves under the desktop app's bundler and does NOT resolve under `bun test`,
// so `import { RETRIEVAL_MODE_SCOPE } from "./spaces.tsx"` fails at module load —
// verified, not assumed. Reading the literal out of the source is the honest
// alternative for an assertion about a *string*: {@link copyLiteral} THROWS when a
// constant is missing or re-spelled, so a renamed export reads as "go fix this
// test", never as a silently-passing scan of a file that no longer says anything.

// ── "This file is stored, but its contents are not searchable" ────────────────

// exist because those five states carry FOUR different user actions. The tests pin
