// its seeded backdrop, its type, and the member's own referral line. The tabs,
// the format ladder, the recorder and the four actions all live in
// <PassShareDialog>, which is shared with the paid-tier card.
//
// The picture here is the REAL card — the same warp shader, the same metal ring,
// turned in real perspective — rather than the flat side-by-side raster that
// `/api/og/pass` draws. See `@ryu/ui/components/pass-studio`. That raster is
// still what an unfurled `/pass` link shows, because an `og:image` has to be a
// URL a crawler can fetch and this one is made in the member's own browser.
//
// ONE definition for both waitlist screens (`apps/web` waitlist-view.tsx and the
// desktop's WaitlistPage.tsx), which is why `host` and `isDark` are props rather
// than read off `window.location` and `next-themes`: the desktop shell's own
// host is `tauri.localhost`, and printing that under the card would put a dead
// address on every picture a desktop member posts.
