/*
 * The landing hero's visualisation: a looping, scripted run of ONE real Ryu
 * workflow across BOTH surfaces, so the two-surface story is shown instead of
 * asserted.
 *
 *   Island (always on top, glanceable)  →  Desktop app (where the work runs)
 *
 * The stage reads as a real desktop: the hero's background image is the
 * wallpaper, the scaled window is the app, and the island floats OUTSIDE that
 * window — centred on the wallpaper above it — because that is where an
 * always-on-top pill actually lives. The phase strip and the surface legend sit
 * BELOW the window so the top of the frame is the island's alone.
 *
 * The beat list is the whole script: every visual — island state, cursor,
 * transcript contents, caption, phase chip — is DERIVED from the current beat
 * index, so the loop restarting is just `index = 0` and there is no accumulated
 * state to drift. Beats advance on a timer that only runs while the stage is on
 * screen; `prefers-reduced-motion` freezes it on the finished beat instead.
 *
 * Like the showcase it replaces, this is NOT a redrawn approximation: it composes
 * the same real `DesktopShell` + `AgentChat` the app ships, and the island is the
 * real island shape vocabulary from `island-shapes.tsx`. The transcript is fed
 * real AI-SDK v5 tool parts, so the tool rows are the app's own renderers.
 *
 * The persistent site island (`GlobalIsland`) is suppressed while this stage is
 * visible — one island on screen at a time.
