//
// The Animated Gradient, as this repo ships it: paper's `Warp` shader under six
// named presets, with a STATIC paint of the same preset always underneath it.
//
// WHY THE STATIC LAYER IS NOT OPTIONAL. This renders through WebGL, not CSS.
// Browsers cap simultaneous WebGL contexts (~16) and evict the OLDEST one to
// honour a new request, so a surface that mounts many of these does not degrade
// gracefully — it kills its own earlier instances. Sentry RUST-2A on this app is
// already that failure ("InvalidStateError: Failed to execute
// transferToImageBitmap … WebGL context is lost"). Three consequences, all
// enforced here rather than documented:
//
//  1. `live` is OPT-IN and defaults to false. A caller that does not ask for the
//     shader gets a plain painted div — no canvas, no context, no rAF. Grids and
//     lists are therefore static by construction, not by discipline.
//  2. The static paint is the element's own `background`, painted whether or not
//     the canvas mounts. An evicted or failed context leaves that paint standing
//     instead of a hole, which is the difference between "the animation stopped"
//     and "the hero went black".
//  3. `prefers-reduced-motion` UNMOUNTS the canvas rather than freezing time.
//     Upstream gives no reduced-motion guidance and the obvious reading —
//     `speed: 0` — still holds a GL context and still runs the compositor. Stopped
//     means stopped.
//
// The static paint is derived from the SAME preset table the shader reads, so a
// preset edit cannot desync the two. It is a CSS approximation (a three-stop ramp
// plus two radial pools), not a captured frame: a frame would be a raster asset
// per preset per palette, and authors supply their own colours.
//
// PROVENANCE OF THE NUMBERS. `prism` is exact — its uniforms are the ones
// `apps/web/src/lib/og-prism.ts` already froze to re-derive this same look on the
// CPU for social cards, which are upstream's documented defaults. The other five
// are house interpretations of the named looks, not upstream-exact values; they
// live in one table so correcting one is a one-place edit.
