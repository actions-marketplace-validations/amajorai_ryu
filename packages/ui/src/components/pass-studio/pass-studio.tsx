/**
 * The pass, as a shareable picture or a looping video.
 *
 * The card is drawn into a `<canvas>` rather than mounted as DOM because that
 * is the only surface a clipboard and a recorder can both read — but the parts
 * that make the card look like itself are NOT redrawn. Two hidden hosts below
 * mount the real `warp` shader and the real `MetalEdge`, and the scene samples
 * their canvases every frame. What a member exports is the same shader field
 * and the same chrome ring that is turning on the screen behind the dialog.
 *
 * The hosts are `position: fixed` and `opacity: 0` rather than `display: none`
 * or off-screen. Both libraries gate painting on an IntersectionObserver, which
 * reports GEOMETRY: a laid-out, in-viewport, fully transparent box keeps
 * painting, while a hidden or zero-sized one is told it is off-screen once and
 * never asked again, and paints nothing forever. This is the same workaround
 * `metal-edge.tsx` already carries for its keep-alive instance.
 *
 * They are PORTALLED to `document.body` rather than rendered inline, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than tidiness. This component's first consumer is a
 * dialog, and dialog content animates in on a `transform` — which makes it a
 * containing block for `position: fixed`, so an inline host would be fixed to
 * the DIALOG, not the viewport. It would then move while the open animation
 * runs, which is exactly the moving-box case `metal-edge.tsx`'s two-frame mount
 * gate exists to avoid: the observers are asked once, mid-animation, and an
 * instance told it is out of view is never asked again.
