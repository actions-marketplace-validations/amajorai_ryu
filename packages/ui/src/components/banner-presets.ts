// packages/ui/src/components/banner-presets.ts
//
// The ONE catalog of banner styles a surface can offer a user: the generative
// dither wash the app has always painted, plus every gradient preset the shared
// animated-gradient table defines.
//
// It lives in `@ryu/ui` rather than next to either consumer because the two
// consumers cannot see each other. `packages/marketplace` depends on
// `@ryu/blocks`; `packages/blocks` does NOT depend on `@ryu/marketplace`, so a
// preset list defined in the marketplace package is structurally unreachable
// from the agent editor (which lives in blocks) — that is a dependency-graph
// fact, not a preference. `@ryu/ui` is the only package both already depend on.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO: define gradients. The gradient presets are
// `ANIMATED_GRADIENT_PRESETS` from `./motion/animated-gradient.tsx` — the same
// table the marketplace's listing banners paint from and the same one the WebGL
// shader reads. This module only ADAPTS them into a picker list and recolours
// them; adding a preset there adds it to the agent-banner dialog with no edit
// here, and there is exactly one place where "what does `prism` look like" is
// answered. A second, hand-rolled ramp table in this file would be the fork the
// shared table exists to prevent.
//
// The list is a discriminated union on `kind` so a surface can paint one without
// knowing which entry it got:
//
//   * `kind: "dither"` — painted with dither-kit's `DitherGradient` on a canvas.
//     One entry, because the dither style's variation is its COLOUR and
//     DIRECTION, not a per-variant recipe.
//   * `kind: "gradient"` — painted as a CSS background string from
//     `bannerGradientCss`.
//
// STATIC, NOT LIVE. `bannerGradientCss` returns the shader's static CSS
// approximation (`animatedGradientCss`), never a WebGL canvas. The agent-banner
// surfaces are a header, a dialog preview and a grid of style tiles — mounting a
// `<AnimatedGradient live>` for each would be ~8 GL contexts against a browser
// cap of ~16 that EVICTS the oldest to honour a new one, which is Sentry RUST-2A
// on this app. See that component's header; the rule there is that only a detail
// hero opts in, and a banner picker is not one.
//
// RECOLOURING. A gradient preset's three stops are literal colours, but the
// banner picker's colour control has to keep working across styles. So a preset
// is treated as a SHAPE plus a hue RELATIONSHIP: every stop is rotated by the
// same delta, taken from the preset's own signature stop to the user's chosen
// hue. Relative hue spacing, saturation and lightness all survive, so a
// recoloured `prism` still reads as prism — and a near-grey stop (`lava`'s
// near-black, `mist`'s off-white) barely moves, because rotating the hue of an
// unsaturated colour is close to a no-op. That is why the rotation is on hue
// alone and not a wholesale palette substitution.
