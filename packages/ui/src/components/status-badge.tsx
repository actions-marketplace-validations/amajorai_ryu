// packages/ui/src/components/status-badge.tsx
//
// The ONE status attribute chip: Active · Unavailable · Built-in · Default.
//
// Those four words were rendered as TEXT in seventeen places across four
// packages, in three different visual treatments — a `<Badge variant="secondary">`
// here, a bare string inside a disabled `<Button>` there, a `string[]` entry in a
// hero's badge row somewhere else. On a two-column grid of listing rows that is a
// wall of grey words repeating what the row's own controls already say, and it is
// the single thing that made the Store read as busy.
//
// A glyph with the word on hover says the same thing in a quarter of the width.
// The pattern is not new here: `verified-badge.tsx` in @ryu/marketplace has been
// the icon-plus-tooltip chip for the publisher check since it shipped, and every
// structural decision below is copied from it deliberately.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN @ryu/ui. The call sites span packages/marketplace,
// packages/blocks, apps/desktop and apps/web. `@ryu/ui/components/tooltip.tsx` is
// the only module all four already import — marketplace explicitly refuses to
// import blocks source (see `skill-list-row.tsx`'s header), so neither of those
// packages could have owned it.
//
// WHY THE TRIGGER IS A <span role="img">, NEVER A <button>. Two independent
// reasons, both live:
//   • `StoreCatalogCard` wraps every row in a stretched `absolute inset-0`
//     <button>, and `SkillListRow` IS a <button>. A nested button is invalid HTML
//     that browsers "repair" by dropping the inner one — the control vanishes with
//     no type error and no failing build.
//   • `TooltipContent` is portaled, so `renderToStaticMarkup` never emits it. The
//     `aria-label` is therefore the ONLY thing a static-markup test (or a screen
//     reader walking the card's accessible name) can see. It carries the label, so
//     replacing text with a glyph loses nothing to assistive tech.
//
// The provider is self-contained rather than assumed: this renders on both hosts
// and web mounts no global TooltipProvider. Nesting one inside an existing
// provider is harmless.

 *     places, and not `LockedIcon`, which the agent editor already uses for a
 *     DIFFERENT badge ("Locked") on the very same line as its "Built-in" one.
 *   • `StarCircleIcon` — not `StarIcon`, which is the Library's favourite star and
