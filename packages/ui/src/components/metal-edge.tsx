/**
 * The metal edge — one tuning of `metal-fx` (metal.jakubantalik.com), shared by

 *
 * It exists so the ring is one decision rather than five: the waitlist pass, the
 * agent employee badge and the queue screen's own tiles all carry the same
 * chrome, and a per-call-site copy of `preset` / `ringCssPx` / `shaderScale`
 * would drift the moment one of them was retuned. The library ships only
 * `button` (134×40 baseline, 1px ring, shaderScale 1.6) and `circle` variants —
 * neither reads correctly stretched over a card, so the ring is widened and the
 * shader zoomed out here, once.
 *
 * All instances on a page share ONE offscreen WebGL canvas inside `metal-fx`, so
 * ringing several surfaces costs one context, not one per card.

 * This is not decoration — it is a workaround for a teardown in `metal-fx` that
 * is destructive and unrecoverable. When its instance set empties, the library
 * does not merely stop the shared render loop: it deletes the GL program and
 * buffer and calls `WEBGL_lose_context.loseContext()` on the shared canvas, then
 * drops the renderer entirely. React StrictMode — on by default in the Next dev
 * server, absent from the desktop's Vite harness — mounts every component twice
 * (create, destroy, create), so a page whose only ring belongs to one component
 * empties that set mid-mount and kills the context before the second mount
 * arrives. The ring then paints at most one frame and never animates again.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape of the bug on the waitlist screen: dead while the
 * only ring was the handle field, alive the moment a claimed handle added the
 * card's rings, dead again on unreserve.
 *
 * Keeping one instance alive for the life of the document means the count never
 * reaches zero, so the teardown never runs. It costs nothing: instances share a
 * single WebGL canvas, and this one is 8x6 CSS pixels at 1% opacity.
