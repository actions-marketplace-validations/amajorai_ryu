/**
 * The card's milled edge has now regressed TWICE into the same report — "it
 * reads as two cards stacked, joined at the waist" — and both times the cause
 * was visible in the arithmetic below rather than in anything React did.
 *
 * The first time, the lengthwise ramp was symmetric (bright, DARK, bright), so a
 * grey band sat across the exact middle of the edge. The second time, a merge
 * kept that fix but dropped `edgeSliceFill`, so every slice of the thickness
 * painted the identical column and the edge had no shading ACROSS itself — which
 * leaves the two face rings as the only depth cue and reads, again, as two
 * cards.
 *
 * These tests assert those two properties directly. They are deliberately
 * structural rather than snapshot-shaped: a snapshot would have to be updated by
 * whoever retunes the ramp, and "update the snapshot" is not a decision anyone
 * makes carefully.
