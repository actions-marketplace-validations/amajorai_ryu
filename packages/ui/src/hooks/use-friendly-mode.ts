// packages/ui/src/hooks/use-friendly-mode.ts
//
// THE one shared, persisted toggle for the app-wide "Friendly names" mode. On by
// default: technical vocabulary (model repo names, quant labels, retrieval
// strategies, embedding jargon) is replaced with plain language a non-developer
// can read. Turning it off shows the developer-accurate term instead.
//
// This lives in `@ryu/ui` — the leaf package `@ryu/blocks`, `@ryu/marketplace`,
// `@ryu/settings` and `apps/desktop` all already depend on — precisely so there is
// ONE module-level `listeners` Set. That is not tidiness, it is a correctness
// requirement, and the bug it fixes was live:
//
//   The desktop (`apps/desktop/src/hooks/useFriendlyMode.ts`) and the marketplace
//   (`packages/marketplace/src/catalog/use-friendly-mode.ts`) each had their own
//   copy of this store, each with its own `listeners` Set over the SAME storage
//   key. The `storage` event does not fire in the document that performed the
//   write — that is the whole point of it — so flipping the toggle in the
//   Appearance tab (a desktop-hook write) notified only the desktop's listeners.
//   A marketplace-rendered catalog section mounted in the same window kept
//   rendering the old vocabulary until it happened to remount. Cross-WINDOW sync
//   worked; same-window sync did not. Two stores over one key can only ever be
//   half-connected, so the fix is one store, not another listener.
//
// The storage key keeps its historical `ryu.catalog.*` name so every existing
// user's preference carries over even though the setting is now global rather
// than catalog-scoped. Do not "clean it up": renaming it silently resets the
// preference for everyone who ever turned it off.
