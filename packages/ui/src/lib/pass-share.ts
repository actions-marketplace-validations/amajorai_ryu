// One builder, four callers, and they must agree exactly: the `/pass` page
// renders from these params, its `og:image` points at `/api/og/pass` with the
// same ones, the web queue screen's share dialog links to that page, and so
// does the desktop's. If they drifted, the picture in the dialog and the
// picture X unfurls would be different images of the same card.
//
// It lives in `@ryu/ui` rather than `apps/web` because the desktop waitlist
// gate shares the same dialog — see `@ryu/blocks/web/waitlist-share-dialog`.
// Kept free of React imports so `apps/web`'s server-rendered `/pass` page can
// use it without pulling a client component into its module graph.
