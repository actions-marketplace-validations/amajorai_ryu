// The facts a queued member's shareable pass is drawn from, derived ONCE for
// both waitlist screens (web `waitlist-view.tsx`, desktop `WaitlistPage.tsx`).
//
// This exists because the position gate is a rule, not a value: a queue too
// small to show a number on screen must not leak one into a picture — or into
// the compose text — posted to X. That rule used to live inline in the web
// screen only, which is exactly how the desktop ended up posting "spot #42"
// off a queue the web page was still hiding.
//
// Split out of `pass-share.ts` so that file stays React-free for the
// server-rendered `/pass` page; `QUEUE_STATS_MIN` lives in a client component.
